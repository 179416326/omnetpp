FIFO-2
~~~~~~
Another flavour of FIFO, implemented with handleMessage() instead
of activity(). gen.cc uses FSM.

Demonstrates:
  - subclassing simple modules
  - using handleMessage()
  - decomposing handleMessage() into several functions
  - the FSM macros (used to implement BurstyGenerator) and FSM_DEBUG
  - using simple statistics and output vectors
  - using finish()

Fifo-2 implements the same functionality as Fifo-1, but using handleMessage()
instead of activity(). handleMessage() is better suited for large-scale
simulations, and many people also find it easier to understand than activity().
