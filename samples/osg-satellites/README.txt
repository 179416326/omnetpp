This sample requires Qtenv and demonstrates how to render 3rd party mapping data in OMNeT++,
using OpenSceneGraph (http://www.osgearth.org) and osgEarth (http://osgearth.org/).
OpenSceneGraph is an open source high-performance 3D graphics toolkit, used
by application developers in fields such as visual simulation, games, virtual
reality, scientific visualization and modeling. osgEarth is a terrain rendering library
implemented on top of OpenSceneGraph. osgEarth can work with many data sources including
OpenStreetmap, Yahoo Maps, Bing Maps, MapQuest and ReadyMap, just to name a few.
