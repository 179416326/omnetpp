DO NOT REMOVE THIS .METADATA DIRECTORY FROM THE REPOSITORY!

It is present to ensure that all sample projects are automatically
imported into the workspace when the user points the IDE to samples/
as workspace directory.

How it works: The following directory

.plugins/org.eclipse.core.resources/.project

contains a subdir for each project that should be imported into the
workspace by default.

NOTE: ONLY the directories should be checked in, but no files please!
