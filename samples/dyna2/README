DYNA
====

Models a client-server application.

Demonstrates:
 - experimental message subclassing
 - dynamic module creation
 - using WATCH()
 - star topology (with the number of modules passed as parameters)

This model is very similar to Dyna. The only difference is that instead of
working with cPars, here we use the message subclassing feature to add fields
to messages. The dynapacket.msg file contains the message descriptions.
