Fifo 1
~~~~~~
Single-server queue model.

Demonstrates:
  - simple module inheritance
  - decomposing activity() into several functions
  - using simple statistics and output vectors
  - printing stack usage info to help optimize memory consumption
  - using finish()

AbstractFifo can be used as a base class for modules implementing
more sophisticated tasks. You can derive your simple module
class from AbstractFifo and redefine the following member functions:
    void arrival(cMessage *msg)
    simtime_t startService(cMessage *msg)
    void endService(cMessage *msg)
These functions are called whenever a message arrives, begins service etc.
StartService() should return the service time for the message.

ACBFifo and ACPFifo demostrate how to do this.
