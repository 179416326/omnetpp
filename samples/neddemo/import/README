This folder contains sample input for the various Import wizards contributed
by this project into the "New OMNeT++ Project" wizard of the IDE.

Both the data files and the Import wizards are intended as "proof of concept",
and to show what sort of wizards can be implemented with a handful of small
source files. It is expected that end users will copy and modify these 
wizards to adapt them to the particular file formats used in their simulation 
projects.

The wizard sources are under the templates/ folder.
