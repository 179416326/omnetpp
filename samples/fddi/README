FDDI
~~~~
A precise FDDI simulation.

Demonstrates:
  - using statistics classes
  - ...

Two FDDI rings (Southern Ring and Northern Ring) connected by a router.
The offered load of the ring is generated from histograms, from files
in the load/ directory.

The simulation can run in parallel: the two rings execute on separate
processors, and they are synchronized with the statistical synchronization
method. This means that not the actual messages but the statistical
characteristics of the message flow (frame length histograms etc) are
exchanged between the two segments.

Please read the Examples manual.
