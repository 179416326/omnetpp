FDDI24.arj:
  more or less working FDDI ring version, implemented as a vector of computers
FDDI30.arj:
  preparing for TUB Northen FDDI ring smulation, it compiles, but runs still
  the vector implemented ring as in fddi24.arj
FDDI31.arj:
  the token goes round amoung 3 stations of the N. ring
FDDI33.arj:
  The topology of the Northen ring is decribed, everywhere the same cable is used
  compiles, but does not run: loop bounday problems with CON-s.
  ...
FDDI37.arj:
  Takes the load of the fddi stations from files, runs only under linux, because
  the file names are 12 char long. (MAC address)
FDDI38.arj:
  Runs under dos correctly too: the last 6 characters of the linux filenames are
  used under dos.
  ...
FDDI40.arj:
  The MAC algorithm was rewised according to the FDDI MAC standard.
  The algorithm used is described in: STATETR2.XLS
  This version seems to operate correctly
FDDI41.arj:
  The direction of the connections was reversed, because they're always
  "upstream neighbours"
  The address of Goliat was corrected to "Sun___1BD035"
  The sniffer is stll in its old place, it should be transferred, if the new 10
  results would be used
FDDI42.arj:
  The real cable lengths are used: transmission delay is calculated from them
  using light speed of 200m/microseconds
  ...
FDDI45.arj:
  Rewritten for the new version of OMNeT++ (sim 103)
FDDI46.arj:
  The last version before building a real "Sniffer". Here, sniffer is still just
  a SAS.
FDDI47.arj:
  An FDDI_Sniffer exists, but its simples moules have empty activity() functions.
  Compiles, but doest work for the reason above.
FDDI48.arj:
  The FDDI_Sniffer is coded, but not tested yet. It is very much like its base
  class the differences are: two virtual member functions redefined.
  (and these are made virtual in the base class)
  ERROR: repeat loses the name of the FDDI_FRAME-s
FDDI49.arj
  Runs correctly (without msg name loss) with the new simulation kernel
FDDI50.arj
  IdleTimes mechanism deleted.
  There is only one FDDI_MAC activity function.
  if ( findpar("StationID") < 0 )
    my_station_id = parentmod()->index(); //in the case of a ring made by indexing
  else
    my_station_id = par("StationID")

FDDI51.arj
  In the NeD file:
  - parameter max_idle deleted
  - time is given in ns and us
  - between stations in the same building, 10m cable length is assumed
  In the .cc file:
  FDDI_Sink and FDDI_Monitor::activity() functions...
FDDI51a.arj
  Thinking about introducing a parameter "TrafficFromTracefile"...
FDDI51b.arj
  Introducing the parameter mentioned above, taking the load from tracefile
  if yes and from previously saved statistics file, if no. But the second is
  NOT finished yet!
FDDI52.arj
  Introducing the parameter "TrafficFromTracefile", taking the load from
  tracefile if yes and from previously saved statistics file, if no.
FDDI53.arj
  A hierarcy of FDDI_Generator classes was introduced.
  The user can select the generator type of the SAS-s from the *.ini file.
  Possible types:
  - FDDI_GeneratorFromTraceFile
  - FDDI_GeneratorHistogram2x1D // not tested yet
  - FDDI_GeneratorPiSquare2x1D // not implemented yet
  - FDDI_GeneratorKSplit2x1D // not implemented yet
  - FDDI_GeneratorKSplit2D // not implemented yet
FDDI54.arj
  - Bugfixes
  - LoadMultiplier introduced
  - virtual char * FileNameEnding() introduced
  - FDDI_GeneratorPiSquare2x1D: implemented, not tested
  - directory "res" was renamed to "load"
  - version.log introduced
FDDI54a.arj
  - Bugfix in load filename, + linux will use also the 6 char. card addresses
FDDI55.arj
  - two interconnected rings, routing on the basis of the packet length statist.
FDDI56.arj
  - SSM OIF and IIF implemented
  - TUBw NRing and SRing connected with wires
  - TUBs NRing and SRing connected through OIF - IIF pairs
FDDI56a.arj
  - bugfixes
FDDI56b.arj
  - RingID2prefix() function was introduced
    case 0 : return "nr"
    case 1 : return "sr"
    default: return 0
    prefixes for load file names.
    eg. "./load/nr000728.trc"
FDDI56c.arj
  - bugfix: new cMsg(*msg) was replaced by msg->dup()
FDDI56d.arj
  - NR, SR : correct cable lengths, IDs, network description files: "*."
FDDI57.arj
  - all kinds of bugfixes, runs with sim133, produces results!
FDDI58.arj
  - bugfixes
  - histogram constructors always get the appropriate parameters
  - OIF and IIF classes have data members or constructors/destructors NO MORE
FDDI59.arj
  - ported to PVM, just the code is modified, NOT tested yet!
FDDI60.arj
  - the program runs, but the simulation times of the segments are not
    synchronized yet. (runs with Aug. 6. version of sim)
FDDI61.arj
  - the code for sync is written, the OIF's take the parameters from file:
    - "delete" and "send" commands (send is the default, can be omitted)
    - "every", "at" and "from - to - step" constructions
  the sync. function calls are commented out, so it compiles.
  Tested, seems to work. (except for the sync, of course)
FDDI62.arj
  - syncpoint calls are added, runs parallel well.
    (Histogram dup() bugfix in sim. kernel was done.)
  - SSM-UI (time driven) produces similar results than SSM-UT (counter driven).
  - SSM-UI-1 and SSM-UI-2 produce slightliy different results, because SSM-UI-1
    runs in one task and both rings use the same random number generator, but
    SSM-UI-2 runs in two tasks and the two rings use 2 random number generators.
FDDI63.arj
  - bugfix: in case of empty histogram no packets to be generated by the IIF
FDDI64.tgz
  - converted to be runnable with simulation kernel sim148e
  - the implementation of the FDDI MAC was placed into file fddi_mac.cc
FDDI65.tgz
  - separate files for different parts:

    The essential files for the FDDI MAC:
    fddi_mac.ned fddi_def.h fddi_mac.h fddi_mac.cc

    The files for the SSM Input and Output interfaces:
    ssm_ifs.ned ssmifdef.h ssm_ifs.h ssm_ifs.cc

    The file that contains the topology description of the FDDI network:
    fddi_net.ned

    Other parts of the simulation:
    othermod.ned otherdef.h othermod.h othermod.cc
FDDI66.tgz
