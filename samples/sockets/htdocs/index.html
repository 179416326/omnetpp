<h3>Sockets (Hardware-in-the Loop Simulation Demo)</h3>

<p>
This is an example how one can implement hardware-in-the-loop simulation
with OMNeT++/OMNEST. Hardware-in-the-loop means that some external device
is taking part in the simulation. (In other scenarios, the simulation may
implement a device in a real system).

<p>
This example contains two simulation models:

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="httpmodel.html">HTTP</a> model (the one you're currently 
      running)
  <li>The <a href="telnetmodel.html">Telnet</a> model
</ul>

<p>
Both simulations are executed in real-time, that is, simulation time is
synchronized to real (wall clock) time. It is recommended that you set
animation speed to near maximum (using the slider at the top of the graphics
window) for the simulation to be able to keep up with real time (you can check
on the performance gauge bar: the simsec/sec gauge should stay around 1.0).

<h3>How it works</h3>

<p>
Hardware-in-the-loop simulation has two ingredients:

 - the simulation has to be synchronized to real time;

 - there has to be a way the simulation can communicate with the real world:
   it has to be able to receive external events, and possibly also to send
   events out of the simulation. The implementation of this external
   communication can be very different from one simulation scenario to another:
   it can be as simple as TCP sockets (as here) or pipes, it can be raw
   communication on an Ethernet NIC or an USB port, or communication with a
   interface card via interrupts and DMA transfer. If you plan to do
   hardware-in-the-loop simulation, you'll most like have to implement your
   own external communication interface.

<p>
The word "real-time" means that the simulation is executed in a way such that
simulation time is synchronized to real time: simulating one second
in the model will also take one "real" second. This is in contrast to
"normal" simulation, when we want the simulation to run as fast as possible.
Of course, the CPU has to be fast enough so that the simulation can keep up
with real time.

<p>
The external interface used in this example simulation is a single TCP socket.

<p>
The models was then configured <a href="config.html">like this</a>.

<p>
Interesting functionality is in the cSocketRTScheduler class. Its source code
is in socketrtscheduler.h/cc. It combines synchronizing to real-time with
socket communication.
