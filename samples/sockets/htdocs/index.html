<h3>Sockets (Hardware-in-the Loop Simulation Demo)</h3>

<p>
This is an example how one can implement hardware-in-the-loop simulation
with OMNeT++/OMNEST. Hardware-in-the-loop means that some external device
is taking part in the simulation. (In other scenarios, the simulation may
implement a device in a real system).

<p>
This example contains two simulation models:

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="httpmodel.html">HTTP</a> model (the one you're currently
      running)
  <li>The <a href="telnetmodel.html">Telnet</a> model
</ul>

<p>
Both simulations are executed in real-time, that is, simulation time is
synchronized to real (wall clock) time. It is recommended that you set
animation speed to near maximum (using the slider at the top of the graphics
window) for the simulation to be able to keep up with real time (you can check
on the performance gauge bar: the simsec/sec gauge should stay around 1.0).

<p>
Read about <a href="how.html">how it works</a>.

<p>
The model was then configured <a href="config.html">like this</a>.

<p>
Interesting functionality is in the cSocketRTScheduler class. Its source code
is in socketrtscheduler.h/cc. It combines synchronizing to real-time with
socket communication.
