<h3>Real-time simulation</h3>

<p>
The word "real-time" means that the simulation is executed in a way such that
simulation time is synchronized to real time: simulating one second
in the model will also take one "real" second. This is in contrast to
"normal" simulation, when we want the simulation to run as fast as possible.
Of course, the CPU has to be fast enough so that the simulation can keep up
with real time.
