<h3>The Telnet model</h3>

<p>
TelnetNet is similar to HTTPNet, but clients maintain telnet sessions
to the server. The server echoes every character (in uppercase, to make it
more interesting, and prints control characters in a readable form).
Telnet clients are simulated except one, which is a proxy for a real-life
client. By telnetting to localhost, port 4242 you can send your own
keypresses over the simulated network to the simulated server.

<p>
To try:

<ul>
  <li> start the simulation with the "Run" button on the toolbar
  <li> on Windows: open a command prompt (Start->Run->cmd.exe), and type
       "telnet localhost 4242"
  <li> on Linux/Unix: type "telnet localhost 4242" on the shell prompt, then
       put your telnet into character mode (otherwise it'll send your keypresses
       only when you hit Enter.) On my telnet this was done by pressing Ctrl+],
       then typing "mode character" followed by Enter.
  <li> then type into the telnet program, and watch how your keypresses get
       into the simulated network.
</ul>
