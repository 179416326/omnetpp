 - Borland C++ project file (*.ide) removed, Makefile.bc added (unsupported!)
 - MSVC makefiles and project files now contain the OMNeT++ include and lib
   directories with absolute paths (previously they were relative paths,
   like ..\..\lib). This means the samples will compile even when they're moved
   to another location in the file system.
------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------
