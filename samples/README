Sample simulations
==================

Here's a short list of the sample simulations and what they do.
T: topic
D: which OMNeT++ features it demonstrates

----

Demo
====
T: tour of the other sample simulations
D: several models in one executable
   makefile for models built from sources in several directories

Nim
===
T: a simple two-player game
D: module inheritance
   module type as parameter 


HCube
=====
T: hypercube network with deflection routing
D: hypercube topology with dimension as parameter
   topology templates
   output vectors 


Token
=====
T: Token Ring network
D: ring topology with the number of nodes as parameter
   using cQueue 
   wait() and the putaside-queue 
   output vectors 


Fifo1
=====
T: single-server queue
D: simple module inheritance
   decomposing activity() into several functions 
   using simple statistics and output vectors
   printing stack usage info to help optimize memory consumption
   using finish() 


Fifo2
=====
T: another fifo implementation
D: using handleMessage() 
   decomposing handleMessage() into several functions 
   the FSM macros
   simple module inheritance
   using simple statistics and output vectors
   using finish() 


FDDI
====
T: FDDI MAC simulation
D: using statistics classes and many other features 


Hist
====
T: demo of the histogram classes
