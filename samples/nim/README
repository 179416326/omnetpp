NIM
~~~

A simple game.

Demonstrates:
 - module inheritance
 - module type as parameter

Nim is an ancient game with two players and a bunch of sticks (here also
called tokens). The players take turns, removing 1, 2, 3 or 4 sticks
from the heap of sticks at each turn. The one who takes the last stick
is the loser.

The game is modelled in OMNeT++ as a network with three modules:
the 'game' (a manager module) and two players.

The model of the Nim game is similar to 'Hello world!' by complexity,
but it nicely demonstrates the modelling approach used by OMNeT++.
