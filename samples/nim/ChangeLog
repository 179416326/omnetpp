	* ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

	* MSVC makefiles and project files now contain the OMNeT++ include
	and lib directories with absolute paths (previously they were
	relative paths, like ..\..\lib). This means the samples will
	compile even when they're moved to another location in the file
	system.

	* Borland C++ project file (*.ide) removed, Makefile.bc added (unsupported!)
