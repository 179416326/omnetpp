TODO: this should probably be released separately, and not as a sample

TODO: make separate immediate and timed transitions? different icon etc!

TODO: scheduling is currently not fair!! if some transition draws prio=999, it will starve!!

TODO: how to connect it to other modules, e.g. the Queueing lib? E.g.: special Transition that sends a message when fires

TODO: collect statistics!!!
