HIST
====

A demo for the density estimation/histogram classes.

Demonstrates:
 - collecting observations into statistics objects
 - saving statistics objects to file and restoring them
 - using the inspect.lst file in Tkenv

The network consists of a single module; it creates four density
estimation objects and goes into a loop to insert random numbers
into the objects. You have some control over how the density
estimation is done.

Link the simulation with Tkenv, and try the following:
 1. Do one step to make sure the objects are created. Click the Step icon
    on the toolbar.
 2. Open inspectors for the histogram objects. Select Inspect|Module local
    variables... from the menu and double-click 'Histograms' in the window.
    The objects in the activity() function of the module are popped up in
    a list window, with the histogram objects among them. Double-click them;
    a graphical window will pop up for each of them.
         - or -
    Instead of this all, select Options|Load inspector list. This will open
    inspector windows for the objects listed in the inspect.lst file,
    that is, in this case, for the histogram objects.
 3. Run the simulation. The histograms will be continuously updated as the
    simulation executes. Basically, that's it!

If you work on DOS:
Borland C++ 3.1 will link the simulation with Tvenv by default. In Tvenv,
you can do similar things as in Tkenv.
To change to Cmdenv, start bc, go to the project window, then:
    press ^O on TVENV.LIB --> check '[ ] exclude from link' --> OK
    press ^O on CMDENV.LIB --> clear '[ ] exclude from link' --> OK
Then re-link the executable. (Be careful not to link with _both_ Cmdenv and
Tvenv, or the program will hang!)
