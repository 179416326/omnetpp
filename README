OMNeT++
=======

   is a feature-rich C++-based object-oriented discrete event simulation
framework, primarily targeted at the simulation of communication networks
other parallel/distributed systems. OMNeT++ includes a graphical network
editor, a network topology description language, a rich simulation class
library, multiple execution environments (both GUI and command line),
a result plotting tool, good documentation, many sample simulations and
much more...
And it is OPEN SOURCE!

Please look into the doc/ subdirectory where you'll find README files,
installation instructions, license, the manual in PDF, etc. The HTML version
of the manual is in the (won't guess!) html/ subdirectory.

Enjoy!
