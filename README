OMNeT++
=======

OMNeT++ is a feature-rich C++-based object-oriented discrete event simulation
framework, primarily targeted at the simulation of communication networks and
other parallel/distributed systems. OMNeT++ includes a graphical network
editor, a network topology description language, a rich simulation class
library, multiple execution environments (both GUI and command line),
a result plotting tool, good documentation, many sample simulations and
much more... And it is open source!

The doc/ subdirectory contains platform-specific README files with installation
instructions, the license text, the manual (PDF,HTML) and the class library
reference.

After successful installation, if you are new to OMNeT++, the example 
simulations are a good place to begin -- go to the samples/ directory and 
start rundemo.

Enjoy!
