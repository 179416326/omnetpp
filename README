OMNeT++
=======

OMNeT++ is a C++-based object-oriented discrete event simulation framework, 
primarily targeted at the simulation of communication networks and
other parallel/distributed systems. OMNeT++ includes a graphical network
editor, a network topology description language, a simulation class
library, multiple execution environments (both GUI and command line),
a result plotting tool, documentation, many sample simulations and
much more. OMNeT++ is also open source.

Please look into the doc/ subdirectory where you'll find README files,
installation instructions, license, the manual in PDF, etc. The doc/html/
subdirectory contains the HTML version of the manual.
