=======

OMNeT++ is a feature-rich C++-based object-oriented discrete event simulation
framework, primarily targeted at the simulation of communication networks and
other parallel/distributed systems. OMNeT++ includes a graphical network
editor, a network topology description language, a rich simulation class
library, multiple execution environments (both GUI and command line),
a result plotting tool, good documentation, many sample simulations and
much more... And it is open source!

Please look into the doc/ subdirectory where you'll find README files,
