- 070529 ====== A2 version =====
  + added two major compnents to the build (event log viewer and sequence chart
    viewer. It is possible to see and analyse the simulation log files)
  + resize behavior of submodules has changed. If no shape specified for a submodule
    (only icon) than resize attempts will change the image size attribute
    (only 5 size is rendered from the images: verysmall, small, normal, large, verylarge)
  + select all (CTRL-A) now selects all submodules if the selection is in a compound module
    instead off all top level component
  + no automatic layouting. the layout button should be explicitly pressed to 
    re-layout the compound module    
  + Reworked Pin/Unpin functionality. It allows both pinning and unpinning of the
    selected submodules.
  + Added image export to compound module contex menu and also some 
    wizards in OMNEST category. It is possible to generate images for
    all/selected nedfiles in the workspace.
  + revised propery cell editors, added content assist to color/icon editors
  + ned docs/comments for modules in the graphical editor as a tooltip
  + new icon chooser dialog
  + added icon chooser dialog in the graphical editor context menu
  x global undo/redo is working if the Property View is the acive view
  x property sheets do not scroll randomly when a group opened/closed
