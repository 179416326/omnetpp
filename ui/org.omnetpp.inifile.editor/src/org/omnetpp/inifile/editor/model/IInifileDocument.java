/**
 * An interface for high-level manipulation of the contents of an ini file 
 * (as sections and entries).
 * 
 * This interface does not try to make sense of section names, key names
 * and values -- they are just treated as strings. Additional layer(s) 
 * may be needed to deal with these details.
 *
 * Some entries may not be editable (i.e. they are readonly), because they
 * come from included ini files, or for some other reason. It it an error 
 * to try to modify or remove these entries.
 * 
 * This interface assumes that within a section, keys are unique (i.e. multiple 
 * appearances of the same key should be flagged as an error during parsing.)
 * If there're non-unique keys, behavior is undefined: this interface
 * should not be used until this condition gets resolved. 
 * 
 * Note: it is not possible to distinguish multiple sections of the same name
 * (i.e. a non-contiguous section): this interface presents them as a single section.
