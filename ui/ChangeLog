    * Added plugin customization to force workspace refresh on IDE startup.

2010-12-11 Rudolf Hornig

    * IDE: fix of bug #145: Open NED Type dialog comes up empty on first invocation
    NedTypeSelectionDialog now contains a INedChangeListener, and any NED
    change triggers a delayed update of the displayed list.

    * IDE: fix for bug #223: bogus "X seems to be a hand-written makefile" message
    when the makefile was deleted from the disk behind the IDE's back

    * Changed the default OMNeT++ source code formatter profile to match the current INET coding convention.
    Profile is using only spaces instead of tabs for indentation.

    * IDE: fix for bug #222: Chinese comments become gibberish in NED files.
    Solution: wherever possible, save files in the file's own encoding
    (i.e. charset), using content.getBytes(ifile.getCharset()).

2010-12-06 Rudolf Hornig 

    * IDE: Added a "Clean Selected Projects" menuitem to the project explorer context menu. 
    This item DOES NOT clean referred projects.

2010-11-10 Rudolf Hornig

2010-10-19 Rudolf Hornig

    * IDE: fixed resolution of parametric submodule types in NedTreeTraversal

    * IDE: refined the resolution of parametric submodule types
    The actual type needs to be resolved in the project of the inifile,
    not in the project of the compound module that contains the submodule
    (for example, udpApp's type need not be in StandardHost's project INET,
    it may also come from a project that has INET as dependency)

    * SeqChart: Fixed a NPE.

    * SeqChart: fix handling show/hide [self] message reuses toggle buttons
    There was some confusion between those buttons, now they toggle showing/hidign
    only for those arrows that they represent.

    * SeqChart: fix message reuse arrows when affected by a module method call
    The end point for a message reuse was wrong. It used the event's module of
    the begin send entry instead of the context module to determine the Y coordinate.

    * fix issue 180: fixed assert when double coordinate is +-Infinite

    * fix issue 196: use file/configname/runnumber to identify runs of temp chart data

2010-07-13 Tamas Borbely

    * BaseLineChartEditForm: fix issue 182
    When the line property has the same value for each selected line,
    then that value is displayed in the control instead of 'No change'.

2010-07-12 Tamas Borbely

    * small layout fix in BaseLineChartEditForm

2010-07-08 Andras Varga 

    * Scave: fix focus problems (bug #188) by using the new FocusManager class

2010-07-07 Andras Varga 

    * Scave: drawing timeouts come now from preferences

    * Scave: time limit facility for line chart plotting

    * Scave: removed smartMode in LinePlot as it was responsible for bug #181
    Turning off symbols for DOTS line type resulted in empty chart.

    * SeqChart: axis ordering dialog layout improved: buttons move to the right

    * SeqChart: fix: "Show self-messages" button (blue arched arrow) also toggled 
    self-reuse (green) arrows on the chart

2010-06-23 Levente Meszaros 

    * Sequence Chart: Fix for find text bug. Find text did not work in filtered eventlogs.

    * Cleanup the show/hide flags related to message send/reuse arrows.
    A couple of renames and minor tweaks, namely arrows are categorized along
    two axes: reuse/send, self/other.

    * Scave: fix unreadable (black-on-black) filter combo dropdown on ubuntu 10.04
    in Ubuntu 10.04: in the default theme, combo editfield is black-on-white
    and dropdown list is white-on-black, so calling setForeground() on the combo
    will inevitably make one of them unreadable. Workaround: do NOT call
    getForeground().
