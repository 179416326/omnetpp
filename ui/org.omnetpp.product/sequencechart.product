2.    GRANT OF LICENSE AND SCOPE OF USE.

User&quot;) a personal, nonexclusive, non-transferrable and limited license to
use the PRODUCT solely to create, compile, test and deploy, in source or
object code form, your own simulations, while abiding to the following
conditions:

2.2     You may:

2.2.1   You may: install the PRODUCT on a reasonable number of machines
provided that the Named User is the only individual permitted to use the
PRODUCT. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this License, you may
distribute your Works to others for production use. You may also make a
reasonable number of copies of the PRODUCT to backup devices such as hard
disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) physical CD media backup copy of

using OMNEST both internally (in your organizational unit) and externally
as a for-profit service. (You may not provide a &quot;Web Service&quot; under this

distribution of any modified, or derivative product is prohibited.

2.3     You may not:

executable, self-contained simulations is necessary.

2.3.6   You may not: Lease, rent or loan the PRODUCT to any third party.

2.3.7   You may not: Sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the
PRODUCT or any component thereof to any third party except as expressly

the PRODUCT. The rights granted under this License apply only to this

PRODUCT under each Named User License you hold.

3.      GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO COMPILED PROGRAMS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES.

3.1     Relationship with End Users. There are no third party beneficiaries
to this License. Consequently, OPENSIM LTD. provides no warranty at
all to any person, other than the limited warranty provided to you the
original purchaser of the PRODUCT, as set forth herein, and you will be
solely responsible to your End Users (or anyone else who uses or acquires
Works) for support, service, upgrades, or technical or other assistance
(including with respect to any Redistributables included therein), and such
persons will have no right to contact OPENSIM LTD. for any services
or assistance. You will indemnify, defend and hold OPENSIM LTD., its
licensors, its suppliers and each of their respective employees, officers,
directors and affiliates, harmless from and against any claims or
liabilities arising out of or related to the use, procurement, reproduction

3.2     Third Party Software. The PRODUCT, including Redistributables, may
include source code, redistributable files, and/or other files provided by
a third party vendor (&quot;Third Party Product&quot;). Since use of Third Party
Product might be subject to license restrictions imposed by the third party
vendor, you should refer to the on-line documentation (if any) provided
with Third Party Product for any license restrictions imposed by the third
party vendor. In any event, any license restrictions imposed by a third
party vendor are in addition to, not in lieu of, the terms and conditions
of this License.

4.      ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS APPLICABLE TO UPGRADES

If you have purchased an upgrade version of the PRODUCT, it constitutes a
single PRODUCT with the copy of the PRODUCT that you upgraded. This means
that, although you may have two sets of PRODUCT media, you still have only
one license. Therefore, you may not transfer the original copy of the
PRODUCT to any other party.

5.      LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER. OPENSIM LTD. warrants to
you, the original purchaser and to no other party, that any physical media
included with the PRODUCT, as and when provided to you, will be free of
physical defects in materials and workmanship for a period of ninety (90)
days after the date that you initially acquire the PRODUCT. Your exclusive
remedy and OPENSIM LTD.&apos;s sole liability for breach of this warranty
is that OPENSIM LTD. will replace any defective media returned to
OPENSIM LTD. within the ninety (90) day warranty period. This
warranty does not apply to damages resulting from misuse, abuse or neglect.
Any replacement media will be warranted as above for the remainder of the
original warranty period or twenty (20) days from the date we ship it to
you, whichever is longer. EXCEPT FOR THIS EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, THE
PRODUCT IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. OPENSIM
LTD. HEREBY EXCLUDES AND DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES,
INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, RESULTS, EFFORTS OR QUIET
ENJOYMENT. THERE IS NO WARRANTY THAT THE PRODUCT WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR WILL
FUNCTION WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK FOR THE RESULTS
OBTAINED USING THE PRODUCT. TO THE EXTENT THAT OPENSIM LTD. MAY NOT
DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF APPLICABLE LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION
OF SUCH WARRANTY WILL BE THE MINIMUM PERMITTED UNDER SUCH LAW.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES YOU SPECIFIC
LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS, WHICH VARY FROM
STATE TO STATE.

6.      SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES. OPENSIM LTD. is not
required under this License to provide any installation, training or other
services to you. Such services, if available, must be purchased separately.
If, pursuant to a separate support agreement or otherwise, OPENSIM
LTD. provides you with a new release, error correction, update, upgrade or
other modification to the PRODUCT, such modification will be deemed part of
the PRODUCT, and subject to the terms of this License, unless the
modification is expressly provided subject to a separate license agreement.
OPENSIM LTD. reserves the right at any time not to release or to
discontinue release of any PRODUCT and to alter prices, features,
specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates,
general availability or other characteristics of any future releases of the
PRODUCT.

7.      Confidentiality. You acknowledge that the PRODUCT in source code
form remains a confidential trade secret of OPENSIM LTD. You agree to
hold this information in confidence, not disclose it to any person, and not
use it for any purpose other than the use and operation of the PRODUCT as
permitted under this License.

8.      LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL OPENSIM LTD. BE
LIABLE TO ANY PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY,
SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, REVENUE,
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OR DATA, ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO THIS LICENSE OR
THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF OPENSIM
LTD. KNEW, SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. OPENSIM LTD.&apos;S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY ARISING
FROM OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE OR THE PRODUCT, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, IN
TORT OR OTHERWISE, WILL NOT EXCEED THE FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS
LICENSE. THIS SECTION 8 WILL APPLY EVEN IF AN EXCLUSIVE REMEDY HEREUNDER
HAS FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
TO YOU.

9.      THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. OPENSIM LTD. will defend and settle any
suit brought against you by a third party (not your affiliate) based on a
claim that the PRODUCT infringes upon any U.S. copyright and OPENSIM

payable by you under a settlement of such suit. The foregoing obligations
are conditioned on you: (a) notifying OPENSIM LTD. promptly in
writing of such action; (b) giving OPENSIM LTD. sole control of the
defence thereof and any related settlement negotiations; and (c)
cooperating and, at OPENSIM LTD.&apos;s request and expense, assisting in
such defence. If the PRODUCT becomes, or in OPENSIM LTD.&apos;s opinion is
likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim that OPENSIM
LTD. is required to defend, then OPENSIM LTD. may (at its option and
expense) either: (a) procure for you the right to continue using the
PRODUCT; (b) replace or modify the PRODUCT so that it becomes
non-infringing; or (c) terminate this License and your rights hereunder to
use the PRODUCT and refund a pro rata portion of any license fee you paid
under this License, based on a three (3) year PRODUCT life. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, OPENSIM LTD. will have no obligation under this
Section 9 or otherwise with respect to any infringement claim based upon:
(a) any use of the PRODUCT not in accordance with this License or the
PRODUCTs accompanying documentation: (b) any use of the PRODUCT in
combination with other products, equipment, software, or data not provided
by OPENSIM LTD.; (c) any use of any version of the PRODUCT other than
the most current version made available to you; or (d) any modification of
the PRODUCT by any person other than OPENSIM LTD. or its authorized
agents (&quot;Excluded Claims&quot;). You will indemnify OPENSIM LTD. against
all liability, damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys&apos; fees)
resulting from or related to an Excluded Claim. This section 9 states

for third-party claims relating to the PRODUCT.
