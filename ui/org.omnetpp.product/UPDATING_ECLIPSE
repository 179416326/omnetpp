This is a quick checklist what to do when updating to a new Eclipse version.

- Download Eclipse IDE for Automotive Software Developers 
  from eclipse.org/download for your platform.

- start it and access the Help / Install new software dialog. Install the following 
  featues:

  o ChangeLog management tools + ChangeLog management tools C++
  o C/C++ Developmnet Tools SDK
  o Eclipse Git team Provider, JGit, command line interface for jgit
  o C++ Library API Documentation Hover Help
  o Valgrind Tools

- Create a directory named 'target' inside the eclipse dir.

- copy the imageexport plugins/features there

- Go to Delta Pack download at http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads then
  select the latest build (i.e. /drops4/R-4.3.1-201309111000/)

- Extract it in the 'target' directory and rename it to "deltapack"

- adjust the ECLIPSE_HOME directory in 'build-ide-java'

- adjust the REPO urls for CDT and LinuxTools in the build.xml file (to match the actual eclipse version)

- download/mirror the CDT/LinuxTools repo. (This is required to build a multi-platform
  CDT installation): Can be done by invoking:

  $ what=sync-target-cdt ./build-ide-java
  $ what=sync-target-linuxtools ./build-ide-java

  after finishing, the CDT repo mirror should be present in the $ECLIPSE_HOME/target/cdt directory

- Start the new eclipse install, select the 'ui' directory as a workspace. Open 
  org.omnetpp.product/omnetpp-ide.target and click the 
  "Set as Target Platform" link in the upper right corner.

  You are now ready to use the new version.

=============================================================================
Migrating the project.

Start the newly created eclipse ide.
- Set the ECLIPSE_HOME environment variable (pointing to the new installation 
  containing the required addon components. This is required only to build
  the IDE from the command line. The default value for ECLIPSE_HOME can be set in the 
  'build-ide-java' script

- Open org.omnetpp.product/omnetpp-ide.target and click the "Set as Target Platform" link in the
  upper right corner.

- Open org.omnetpp.ide/feature.xml
  - check the "Dependencies" tab and update it as necessary to have the correct version. 
  (Remove/add the features as needed)

  The following features should be present:
      de.unikassel.imageexport 
      com.lowagie.itext
      org.eclipse.gmf.runtime.thirdparty
      org.eclipse.emf.common
      org.eclipse.emf.common.ui
      org.eclipse.emf.ecore
      org.eclipse.emf.ecore.edit
      org.eclipse.emf.edit
      org.eclipse.emf.edit.ui
      org.eclipse.gef
      org.eclipse.platform
      org.eclipse.cdt

  - check the "plugins" page too that the correct versions are present (look for warnings too)
  Use the "Versions" button and select the "Copy the version from plug-in and fragment manifests"
  Take a look especially at the following plugins: 
     org.eclipse.gmf.* 
     org.apache.*
     de.unikassel.*


Optional (not needed if the version numbers are not specified):

- Open org.omnetpp.product/omnetpp-ide.product
  Check the dependencies page and remove/add the packages to make their versions up to date

- Open org.omnetpp.product/omnest-ide.product
  Check the dependencies page and remove/add the packages to make their versions up to date
