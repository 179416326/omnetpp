/**
 * <p>
 * A completely specified animation position designates a single moment in the
 * animation. The animation is pretty much like a movie that flows from the
 * beginning to the end with the current animation speed. Animation positions
 * have a natural ordering based on the moments they designate in the animation.
 * An animation position is said to be less than another if it designates a
 * moment before the moment designated by the other animation position.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An absolute animation time, which is simply measuring the distance from the
 * very beginning of the animation, would be sufficient to specify an animation
 * position. Unfortunately, expressing animation positions this way would make
 * it impossible to compute animation positions lazily, and would prevent
 * handling huge animations effectively.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The concept of relative animation time helps to achieve the above goals by
 * specifying animation positions relative to another moment (called the origin)
 * within the same animation. One such moment is the very first moment of the
 * animation of a single simulation event.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Another important concept is the animation frames. The whole animation is
 * basically a list of interleaved constant and interpolation frames. A constant
 * frame belongs to the very same simulation time and event number and it is
 * identified by them. An animation frame cannot span across multiple events,
 * but there may be multiple animation frames between two subsequent events.
 * Within constant frames the event number and the simulation time are constant.
 * Within interpolation frames the event number is constant, but the simulation
 * time is proportional to the animation time. A constant frame may also be
 * assigned to a simulation time where in fact no event occurred.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An animation position consist of the following values:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>An event number or <code>null</code> if not yet set.</li>
 * <li>A simulation time or <code>null</code> if not yet set.</li>
 * <li>A double value specifying the frame-relative animation time or
 * <code>null</code> if not yet set.</li>
 * <li>A double value specifying the origin-relative animation time or
 * <code>null</code> if not yet set.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An animation position may be partially set and may only become complete
 * later. If none of the elements are set then the position is said to be
 * completely unspecified. If all of the elements are set then the position is
 * said to be completely specified.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An animation position is not allowed change its designated moment in the
 * animation while the program is running. This means that it always designates
 * the very same moment even if some parts have not yet been set. It is almost
 * like an immutable data structure, but unfortunately it is difficult to
 * enforce this constraint.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that there are strict relationships between the parts of an animation
 * position and also where the animation time coordinate system origin is. The
 * following examples assume certain coordinate system origins to simplify the
 * descriptions. Other origins are also possible but they would only change the
 * origin-relative animation time.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <b>begin animation position</b> is the first moment of the initialize
 * animation specified as follows (assuming initialize as being the origin):
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Event number is <code>0</code>.</li>
 * <li>Simulation time is <code>0</code>.</li>
 * <li>frame-relative animation time is <code>0</code> (the first moment in the
 * animation frame).</li>
 * <li>Origin-relative animation time is <code>0</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The <b>first event animation position</b> is the first moment of the first
 * event's animation specified as follows (assuming the first event as being the
 * origin):
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Event number is the event number of the first event.</li>
 * <li>Simulation time is the simulation time of the first event.</li>
 * <li>frame-relative animation time is <code>0</code> (the first moment in the
 * animation frame starting with the first event).</li>
 * <li>Origin-relative animation time is <code>0</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The <b>end animation position</b> is the last moment of the last event's
 * animation specified as follows (assuming the last event as being the origin):
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Event number is the event number of the last event.</li>
 * <li>Simulation time is the simulation time of the last event.</li>
 * <li>frame-relative animation time is the animation frame's size.</li>
 * <li>Origin-relative animation time is the animation frame's size.</li>
 * </ul>
