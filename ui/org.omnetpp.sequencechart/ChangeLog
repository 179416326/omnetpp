	* Added sequence chart support to display module method calls as vertical orange arrows.
	  The arrow's label is the method's name, tooltips are also available.
        * Some message send arrows were drawn incorrectly from the caller module due to not taking
	  into consideration module method calls. From now on these kind of arrows might start from
	  any point on a module's axis, even if there was no event at that simulation time in the
	  callee module.
	* Store various show/hide flags in sequence chart eventlog configuration files.
