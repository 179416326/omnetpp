2007-05-14
----------

Additions:

   + Added wizard for exporing the selected dataset/data items and vectors/scalars.
     The wizard available from the File/Export menu and from the context menu of
     datasets/dataset items and tables of the "Browse data" page.

   + Some new options for CSV export: separator char, line feed, etc.

Fixes:

   + Editor selection was sometimes lost when the "Outline" view was opened.

   + "Selected ..." message in the status bar for ID lists and Run/File.

   + Killed most of java compiler warnings.

2007-04-27
----------

Additions:

   + Enum attributes are read from the vector files and enum values are 
     displayed as strings in the "VectorBrowser" view.

   + Groups can be specified for bar charts.

   + Exporting filtered data in matlab and csv format is available from scavetool.

2007-04-13
----------

Additions:

   + Scatter plots can be generated from scalar datasets.

   + Added "Dataset View" replacing the data table on the "Dataset" page. (not yet finished)

Fixes:

   + Fixed crash when the project containing the input of an active editor is closed.

   + Creating chart templates from temporary charts works again.

2007-03-30
----------

Additions:

   + Simulation time represented as a BigDecimal (int64 value + scale).
     Output vector now may contain time values with different scale. The precise
     values are kept by the dataflow network, when there is no computation with
     the simulation time.
     

Fixes:

   + Chart tooltip shows precise time values of data points.

   + Group names are displayed.

   + Fixed NullPointerException when the "Vector Browser" view is opened.

2007-03-15
----------

Fixes:

   + The indexer does not change the indexed vector file. It is assumed that it was
     generated with an index and it already contains blocks of vectors.

   + If the vector file contains a syntax error, then ResultFileFormatException is thrown
     by the indexer. These exceptions are converted to an error marker, while other exceptions
     are converted to a warning marker.

   + Simulation times are represented by int64 values (long in Java) to prevent loss of 
     precision. Dataflow network still represents them as doubles though.

   + Fixed crashes during indexing by blocking the ResultFilesTracker while indexing.


2007-03-02
----------

Fixes:

   + Only one page can be opened for a chart/dataset. If the page already exists it will
     be activated when the user double-click on the chart/dataset. The pages are closed
     when the chart/dataset is deleted from the model.

   + Fixed minor issues in the content assist (missing spaces,AN+AND=ANAND). The content
     assist is available in the filter fields of edit dialogs too.

   + Fixed exceptions in New... dialogs. The new node is not added to the model until
     the OK is not pressed.

   + Add a combo for selecting the data type of Add/Discard/Select/Deselect operations.
     For Select/Deselect it is set according to the chart type.

   + Default properties are specified for charts. The properties having a default value
     can be reset on the property sheet.

2007-02-16
----------

Additions:

   + Double clicking on result files in the Navigator view, opens the "New Analysis" wizard.
     The analysis file will contain the selected result file. The default name of the analysis
     file is the file name of the result file with the ".scave" extension. If an analysis
     file exists with this name, it is opened instead of the wizard.

   + Selected vectors and scalars can be put on a chart by choosing "Open chart" from the 
     context menu of the table on the "Browse Data" page. The created dataset and chart nodes
     are not saved and not visible on the UI. The user can persist them using the toolbar 
     button.

   + Some toolbar buttons were added.

Fixes:

   + The crosshair on vector charts snaps to the data points.

   + Run attributes are saved in the vector files too, so they can appear on the GUI,
     when the vector was loaded from the index file.


2007-02-02
----------

Additions:

   + Event numbers are stored in vector files. New vector files describes the columns in the
     vector declaration ('E' = event number, 'T' = simulation time, 'V' = vector value).
     Older vector files are accepted by scave (their columns are 'TV').

   + Indexing by simulation time and event number is implemented.

   + Statistical data (min/max/sum/sumsqr) is stored for each vector and for each block
     in the index. It is possible to answer the min/max/avg/stddev for time/event number
     intervals efficiently.

   + Event numbers are displayed in the "Vector Browser" view. There is a sample file (aloha.vec)
     containing event numbers in the repository.

   + "Go to line", "Go to event", "Go to time" actions are available from the pull down menu
     of the "Vector Browser" view.

2007-01-19
----------

Additions:

   + FileOutputVectorManager now saves the run attributes and module parameters in the vector file.

   + The size and date of the vector file is saved in the index file and used to decide
     if indexing is needed.

   + The tabs on the 'Browse Data' page shows the number of Vectors/Scalars/Histograms.

Fixes:


   + Fixed: vector file indexer removed the run attributes and module parameters
     when rebuilt a vector file.

   + The VectorBrowser view shows a message instead of the empty table, when the vector can not
     be browsed, because the index is missing.

   + Loading huge vector files (~100MB) does not block the UI thread, when no index file.
     Actually an index file is generated and the vectors are loaded from it in this case.
     The indexer works in the background as a workspace job.


2007-01-05
----------

Fixes:

   + Content assist and field assist of the filter completed. Content assist can offer 
     operator, field name, field value completions (when asked at the end of a token)
     and replacements (when asked inside the token).

   + The 'Refresh automatically' preference option has 'true' as default value.

   + 'Browse vector' view sometimes was not refreshed.

   + When the index file gets created by the indexer, the table of 'Browse Data' page is
     refreshed.


2006-12-15
----------

Additions

   + Vector file indexer are implemented as a builder. The builder is configured for projects
     having "omnetppnature".

   + A new wizard added for creating OMNeT++ projects. These projects get the "omnetppnature"
     when created.

   + A new view was added for displaying the content of a vector file. Open the view and
     select a vector in the "Browse Data" page to try it out.

   + The filter panel gets reorganized. There is an advanced filter, where the user can 
     enter a match expression and a simple filter, where the patterns for fields can be
     selected from combos. The two filter are synchronized. The advanced filter has a content
     assist (Ctrl+Space), but it not yet finished.

Fixes:

   + Sorting works for newly added columns ('Min','Max', etc) in the data tables.

   + Setting the filter by double-clicking on the Inputs page does not show empty tables.
     It activates the tab that is not empty after applying the filter.

   + Filtering by run attributes crashed, when some run did not have value for the attribute.

2006-12-01
----------

Additions

   + Implementing an indexed vector file writer node.

   + Scavetool now has an 'index' command. It generates an index file for the specified files.

   + Scave editor automatically indexes the vector files in the background. Indexing starts
     when the plugin is loaded, and when changes happened in the workspace. (Turning on/off
     indexing from the Preferences dialog is not yet implemented.) 

   + 'Browse data' page shows 'Count', 'Min', 'Max', 'Mean' and 'Stddev' of vectors having an 
     index file.
   

2006-11-17
----------

Additions

   + Copy charts to the clipboard. Try right click, "Copy".

   + Copy selected data items to clipboard. Select rows in the table of the "Browse data" page
     and press "Copy to clipboard...". Only CSV format is implemented yet.

   + Index files generated by cIndexedFileOutputVectorManager (in sandbox).

   + A vector file reader is implemented for reading indexed vector files.

   + Double click on a vector in the "Browse data" page opens a table with the vector's content.
     The vector must have an index file having the same name as the vector file
     with extension ".vci". (Non-indexed vectors are not shown yet.)

2006-11-03
----------

Additions

   + New zoomable bar chart implementation.


2006-11-02
----------

Additions

   + Cross hair displayed on vector charts. Coordinates are displayed and snipped to
     data points.

   + Line properties can be edited on the property sheet.

   + "Refresh" buttons are added to chart pages.

Fixes

   + Sorting works for all columns in the data tables.


2006-10-27
----------

Additions

   + Line properties can be set per line in the "Edit" dialog of charts.

   + "Edit" dialogs have an "Apply" button.

   + Data table configuration (visible columns) are saved into the plugin's preferences.

   + Sorting works for data tables (except run attribute columns).

Fixes

   + Unused menu items ("Validate", "Control", "Load resource...") removed from the menus.

   + Number of visible items are increased for some combo fields.

   + "New" buttons are replaced with "New child..." and "New sibling" buttons.

   + "Module name" and "Data name" filter hints contain the '*' wildcard.

   + Fixing the crash that happened when the user clicked on the "Dataset" page after she
     deleted the dataset.


2006-10-05
----------

Additions

   + Number of selected/all table rows are displayed in the status line.

   + Edit dialog is available from the context menu of charts.

   + New dialog for editing input files.

   + Visible columns of data tables can be selected.

   + Icons readded to tree views.

   + Input files can be specified by names containing ? and * wildcards.

Fixes

   + Column names changed to be consistent with the names used on the filter panel.

   + When no filter is set, then "<all>" is displayed as the filter. (instead of "")

   + Filter combos can show more items (max 15).

   + "Add to dataset..." inserts the new items at beginning.

   + Empty edit dialogs were shown when the object did not have any editable attribute.

   + Property view is updated when the chart is selected on the property sheet.

   + Fixing "Display symbols" property of vector chart.

   + Default chart sheet were not created when the chart was created by pressing "Create chart..."
     on the "Browse data" page.

   + Double clicking on nodes in the "Inputs" page fills the filters parameters corresponding
     to the ancestors of the clicked node too.

   + Non-selected panel is disabled in "Create dataset"/"Add to dataset"/"Create chart" dialogs.



2006-09-21
----------

Additions

   + New chart automatically added to a default chart sheet which is created on demand.

   + Vector charts extended with legend and title. Their properties can be set from the
     Properties view or from the edit dialog.

   + Input files can be added by pressing the "Add files..." button on the Inputs page.
     "Add with wildcards..." is not yet implemented.

   + Runs are displayed in the logical view under the corresponding replication.

Fixes

   + Filter parameters use less space in the data tables.

   + Title of the "Input files" section is displayed on the Inputs page.

   + When the chart sheet does not have name, "<unnamed>" is displayed in the
     title of the ChartSheet page.

   + NullReferenceExceptions thrown when opening the edit dialog or updating views of charts.
