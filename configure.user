# It is possible to have the Tcl files embedded into the compiled OMNeT++
# libraries and executables. This can be useful if you want to ship 
# standalone executables without having to worry about how to handle
# the Tcl script parts.

# This option is available at present for Tkenv and GNED.

# Here you may help configure to determine which compile switches (e.g. -Ixxx) 
# and which linker switches (e.g. -Lxxx -ltk80 -ltcl80 -lX11) are needed
# to build an app with PVM, Tcl/Tk or Turbo Vision.
#
# Normally these settings are autodetected by configure, so you only need to
# edit here if it isn't up the task.
#
# If you set TK_CFLAGS here, remember to include -fwritable-strings (or the
# equivalent switch for your compiler).

# You may also override the settings below. This is only useful if you
# have moved (want to move) parts of the OMNeT++ distribution to other places
# in the file system (e.g. libraries to /usr/lib, sim headers to
# /usr/include/omnetpp and so on).
#
# At this point, $OMNETPP_ROOT is already set to something like ${HOME}/omnetpp.
