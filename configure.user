# This file contains additional input for 'configure'. It is read (sourced)
# during the configuration process. You are free to edit the settings in here.
#
# The settings in this file are all optional in the sense that they all
# have reasonable default values in the configure script.
#

#
# Compiler optimization switches. Choose -O3 for speed, -g for debugging the libs.
# (Note: For maximum debugging info use switch -ggdb or -gstabs+3 when using gcc and gdb)

#CFLAGS='-g -Wno-unused'
CFLAGS='-g -Wall'
#CFLAGS='-gstabs+3 -Wall'
#CFLAGS='-O3 -DNDEBUG=1'

# To suppress the 'unused variable' warnings in ned-generated _n.cc files
# -Wno-unused is added to NEDCFLAGS
NEDCFLAGS='-Wno-unused'

# Select here whether you want to build static or shared libraries.
# If you change this setting, remember to delete the other set of libraries
# (or at least the soft links from lib/).
# On CYGWIN, only static libraries can be used. The default setting is
# `if-not-cygwin'.

# It is possible to have the Tcl files embedded into the compiled OMNeT++
# libraries and executables. This can be useful if you want to ship
# self-contained standalone executables which do not rely on external
# Tcl scripts.
#
# This option is available at present for Tkenv, GNED and Plove.

# Here you may help 'configure' to determine which compile switches (TK_CFLAGS)
# and which linker switches (TK_LIBS) are needed to build an app with Tcl/Tk.
# Normally these settings are autodetected by 'configure', so you only need to
# edit here if autodetection doesn't work.
#
# In the rare case you need to set TK_CFLAGS, here's what it typically contains:
#    TK_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -fwritable-strings"
# In the above line, /usr/local/include is the directory where tcl.h and tk.h
# live. (This might be different on your system). If they are in different
# directories, you may have to specify multiple -I switches, like this:
#    TK_CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include/tcl -I/usr/local/include/tk -fwritable-strings"
# The '-fwritable-strings' flag is a gcc option Tcl needs. (Actually, permission
# to temporarily overwrite string constants).
#
# TK_LIBS (if you need to set it) normally contains something like this:
#    TK_LIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -ltk8.3 -ltcl8.3"
# /usr/local/lib is the directory that contains the Tcl/Tk library files.
# (Something like libtcl8.3.so, libtk83.a, etc; search for libtcl* and libtk*
# to find them.) The -l options contain the library names: the library file
# names, with the leading 'lib' and trailing '.so*' or '.a*' cut off.
# (Sometimes you need to explicitly link with the X11 libraries too, in that
# case add -lX11 to TK_LIBS).

# You may override the settings below. This is only useful if you have moved
# (or want to move) parts of the OMNeT++ distribution to other places
# in the file system (e.g. libraries to /usr/lib, sim headers to
# /usr/include/omnetpp and so on).
#
# At this point, $OMNETPP_ROOT is already set to something like ${HOME}/omnetpp.
