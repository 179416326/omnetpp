# This file contains additional input for 'configure'. It is read (sourced)
# during the configuration process. You are free to edit the settings in here.
#
# The settings in this file are all optional in the sense that they all
# have reasonable default values in the configure script.
#

#
# Compiler optimization switches. Choose -O3 for speed, -g for debugging
# the libraries.
#
#CFLAGS='-g'
#CFLAGS='-g -Wall'
CFLAGS='-O3 -DNDEBUG=1'

#
# Select here whether you want to build static or shared libraries.
# If you change this setting, remember to delete the other set of libraries
# (or at least the soft links from lib/).
# On CYGWIN, only static libraries can be used. The default setting is 
# `if-not-cygwin'.

#
# It is possible to have the Tcl files embedded into the compiled OMNeT++
# libraries and executables. This can be useful if you want to ship 
# self-contained standalone executables which do not rely on external
# Tcl scripts.
#
# This option is available at present for Tkenv and GNED.

#
# Here you may help 'configure' to determine which compile switches (e.g. -Ixxx) 
# and which linker switches (e.g. -Lxxx -ltk80 -ltcl80 -lX11) are needed
# to build an app with PVM, Tcl/Tk or Turbo Vision.
#
# Normally these settings are autodetected by 'configure', so you only need to
# edit here if autodetection doesn't work.
#
# If you set TK_CFLAGS here, remember to include -fwritable-strings (or the
# equivalent switch for your compiler).

# You may also override the settings below. This is only useful if you
# have moved (want to move) parts of the OMNeT++ distribution to other places
# in the file system (e.g. libraries to /usr/lib, sim headers to
# /usr/include/omnetpp and so on).
#
# At this point, $OMNETPP_ROOT is already set to something like ${HOME}/omnetpp.
