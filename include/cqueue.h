/**
 * Queue class for objects derived from cOwnedObject. The default behaviour of
 * cQueue is a FIFO: you insert elements at the back using insert(), and
 * remove them at the front using pop().
 *
 * By default, cQueue's destructor deletes all contained objects. This behaviour
 * can be changed by calling takeOwnership(false) before inserting objects.
 * More precisely, the behaviour can be controlled per-object: the
 * insertion-time state of the <i>takeOwnership</i> flag will determine
 * whether the inserted object will be deleted by the cQueue destructor or not.
