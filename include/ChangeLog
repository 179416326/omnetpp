       	* cobject.h: cleaned up DOC++ comments

        * Class comments fixed in all files. Comments for methods, functions,
        and macros yet to be done.

	* Some fixes to errors produced by opp_docify.pl: missing #endif at
        bottom of file added, replaced /* */ statements inside comments
        with // //.

	* Merged in documentation from refman.html into header files using
	Andras' helper script opp_docify.pl (affects all files).  unused.txt
        contains doc entries extracted from opp_docify that did not fit into
        the header files.

	src/sim/ChangeLog.)
