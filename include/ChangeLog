	* util.h (class opp_string): use delete[] in functions
	~opp_string, allocate and operator=


2002-03-03  Andras Varga

        * protocol.h: added constants: PR_ICMP, PR_UDP_APP. [suggested by
        Johnny Lai]

2002-03-03  Andras Varga

       	* cpar.h: valueChanges() renamed to beforeChange(); corresponding
        afterChange() method added

       	* macros.h, ctypes.h: Register_Class(), cClassRegister can now be used
        to create instances of non-cObject classes too; as part of this change,
        createOne() return value changed from cObject* to void*.

	* csimul.h: management of various output files (output vector file,
	output scalar file, snapshot file) was moved from cSimulation to the
	user interface library (behind the ev facade); new methods were added
	to cEnvir to support this. (See also following items.)

	* cenvir.h: added new methods to cEnvir: registerOutputVector(),
	deregisterOutputVector(), overloaded recordInOutputVector() methods,
	overloaded recordScalar() methods, getStreamForSnapshot(),
	releaseStreamForSnapshot().

        * coutvect.h: management of output vector file including start time
        and stop time of vectors was completely moved to the user interface
        library; startTime()/stopTime() methods were removed from cOutVector.
        The cOutFileMgr class was removed altogether.

        * envirext.h added: contains abstract classes that can be used to extend
        the functionality of the standard user interface library (src/envir)
        via a plugin mechanism: cOutputVectorManager, cOutputScalarManager,
        cSnapshotManager.

        * index.h: EnvirExtensions doc group added (contains classes in envirext.h)

        * cpar.cc: module parameter change logging feature removed for various
        reasons. (If you miss it, let me know!)

2002-02-22  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* cllist.h (cLinkedList): Doc-fix for cLinkedList::insert()

2002-02-21  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* cobject.h: extended description of CompareFunc regarding return values

	* cqueue.h (cQueue): fixed CompareFunc arguments in Queue class description

2001-10-28 Andras Varga

	* util.h: opp_string::allocate(), opp_strprettytrunc() added;
        indexedname() renamed to opp_mkindexedname() (old name still exists
        as macro)

        * cobject.h, cmodule.h, csimul.h, cgate.h, cpar.h: added
        fullPath2(buffer,buflen) which produces the result in an external
        buffer; cObject::fullPath() now relies on fullPath2().

2001-10-06 Andras Varga

	* cstruct.h: fixed bugs that came up while testing experimental msg
        subclassing

2001-09-14 Andras Varga

	* utils.h: added opp_nextrand(long& seed)

        * cmodule.cc: cModule's display string methods were reorganized:
        displayString(type) method split into displayString() and
        displayStringAsParent(), eliminating the type parameter. Similar change
        to the set...() methods. Old methods remained but were made deprecated.

        * cwatch.h: added unsigned int/long, signed/unsigned char, etc.
        constructors to cWatch.

2001-09-06 Andras Varga

	* cleanup around object copying: every class has now a copy constructor,
        an assignment operator, and every non-abstract class has dup().
        All dup()s call the copy constructor, and all copy constructors
        call the assignment operator. In some classes the assignment operator
        calls copyNotSupported().

2001-08-23 Andras Varga

	* index.h: wrote doc comment about internal classes

        * generated API doc for earlier 2.1 release (undoing API changes
        introduced since 2.1 release on a local copy of the headers)

2001-08-12 Andras Varga

	* documented all typedefs

2001-08-11 Andras Varga

	* added _CONSTs to all copy constructors, operator=()'s and dup()'s
        * improved doc comments in cnetmod.h, cdetect.h, index.h

2001-08-05 Andras Varga

	* added a few dozen new _CONSTs; affects nearly all files

2001-08-04 Andras Varga

	* index.h: added doc comments

2001-08-03 Andras Varga

	* ccor.h cdetect.h cgate.h cmodule.h cobject.h cpar.h csimul.h cstk.h:
        improved/added documentation comments

2001-07-30  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* cenvir.h: operator<< definitions were broken. Introduced with
	revision nr. 1.5. Reverted according to rev. 1.4

2001-07-29 Andras Varga

	* made a lot of methods const (only experimental for now).
        Used a _CONST macro defined in defs.h; _CONST has to be explicitly
        enabled from the makefile (-D_CONST=const). After testing, _CONST
        macros will be replaced by ordinary 'const'. Affects nearly all files.

2001-07-27 Andras Varga

	* cenum.h cfsm.h cnetmod.h cpar.h cstruct.h cwatch.h macros.h util.h:
        improved/added documentation comments

2001-07-24 Andras Varga

	* misc documentation improvements

2001-07-19 Andras Varga

        * added index.h which defines groups for the documentation; updated
        a lot of classes with @ingroup directives.

       	* cdensity.h chist.h cksplit.h cpsquare.h cqueue.h cstat.h ctopo.h
        cvarhist.h chead.h ctypes.h cwatch.h: added/cleaned up DOC++ comments

2001-07-15 Andras Varga

	* added documentation for redefined cObject methods. Affects nearly all
        headers.

2001-07-13 Andras Varga

	* switched to DoxyGen for generating documentation: doxy.cfg added

       	* cmsgheap.h coutvect.h cpacket.h ctopo.h: added/cleaned up DOC++
        comments

2001-07-11 Andras Varga

	* carray.h cgate.h cllist.h cpar.h cqueue.h csimul.h: added/cleaned up
        DOC++ comments

2001-07-07 Andras Varga

        * cmessage.h,cmodule.h,util.h: added/cleaned up DOC++ comments

2001-07-02 Andras Varga

        * cenum.h,cstruct.h: DOC++ comments added (not yet complete)

2001-06-28  Andras Varga

	* utils.h: added DOC++ comments (not yet complete!).

	* cstruct.h added: classes to support self-describing data structures,
        to be used for implementing message subclassing. UNTESTED. To be added
        to the makefile.

        * cenum.h added: classes to support string mapping of enums. UNTESTED.
        To be added to the makefile.

2001-06-23  Andras Varga

       	* cobject.h: cleaned up DOC++ comments

        * Class comments fixed in all files. Comments for methods, functions,
        and macros yet to be done.

2001-06-22  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* Some fixes to errors produced by opp_docify.pl: missing #endif at
        bottom of file added, replaced /* */ statements inside comments
        with // //.

	* Merged in documentation from refman.html into header files using
	Andras' helper script opp_docify.pl (affects all files).  unused.txt
        contains doc entries extracted from opp_docify that did not fit into
        the header files.


2001-06-20  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* const patches applied (affects almost all files)


2001-03-10 Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

	* The include/ directory was created. (Header files were formerly
	in src/sim; if you're interested in earlier changes, refer to
	src/sim/ChangeLog.)
