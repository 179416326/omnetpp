/**
 * Ultimate base class for cOwnedObject, and thus for nearly all
 * \opp classes. cObject is a <b>lightweight common base class</b>:
 * it only contains virtual member functions but NO DATA MEMBERS at all.
 *
 * Note: In OMNeT++ 2.x and 3.x, cObject was called cPolymorphic, and the
 * then-cObject class, a heavier base class has been renamed to cOwnedObject.
 *
 * It is recommended to use cObject as a base class for any class
 * that has at least one virtual member function. This makes the class more
 * interoperable with \opp, and causes no extra overhead at all.
 * sizeof(cObject) should yield 4 on a 32-bit architecture (4-byte vptr),
 * and using cObject as a base class doesn't add anything to the size because
 * a class with a virtual function already has a vptr.
 *
 * cObject allows the object to be displayed in graphical user
 * interface (Tkenv) via the className(), info() and detailedInfo() methods
 * which you may choose to redefine in your own subclasses.
 *
 * Using cObject also strengthens type safety. <tt>cObject *</tt>
 * pointers should replace <tt>void *</tt> in most places where you need
 * pointers to "any data structure". Using cObject will allow safe
 * downcasts using <tt>dynamic_cast</tt> and also \opp's
 * <tt>check_and_cast</tt>.
