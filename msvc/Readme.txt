OMNeT++ Integration Macros (AddNedFile)
=======================================

Requirements: MSVC 6.0.SP1. Without SP1, AddNedFile may crash the IDE due to 
bugs in the Visual Studio Scripting Host.

Installation:
1. The macro file (omnetpp.dsm) should be copied into the following directory:
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Macros
2. Activate the macro file within the MSVC IDE:
   Tools|Customize --> select Add-ins and Macro Files tab --> in the listbox,
   tick 'omnetpp' item
3. Add icons to the MSVC toolbar:
   Tools|Customize again --> select Commands tab --> from the Category combo,
   select Macros --> addNEDfileToProject should appear in the listbox -->
   drag it to a toolbar --> select icon for it --> close dialog
 
(Steps 1 and 2 are normally done by the OMNeT++ install program.)

AddNedFile macro:
-----------------
Purpose: adds a NED file to the currently open OMNeT++ project. This job
includes adding the NED file with a Custom Build Step (that is, calling nedtool)
and adding the corresponding _n.cpp file (which is generated by nedtool) to
the project.

Usage:
  click icon --> inputbox appears --> type ned file name --> the macro will
  add it to the project
Possible caveat:
  - the nedtool compiler is referred to as 'nedtool' in the project file, which
    means the omnetpp bin directrory should be in the path. Or, you can
    substitute the full path of nedtool (e.g. c:\omnetpp\bin\nedtool.exe), 
    either in the Custom Build Step page of the Settings dialog for the NED 
    files, or by find/replace in the dsp file.

AddMSGFile macro:
-----------------
Purpose: adds a message definition file (.msg) to the project. It is very
similar to the AddNedFile macro; see above.
