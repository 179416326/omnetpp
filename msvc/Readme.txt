OMNeT++ Integration Macros (AddNedFile)
=======================================

Requirements: MSVC 6.0.SP1 Without SP1, AddNedFile may crash the IDE due to 
bugs in the Visual Studio Scripting Host.

Installation:
1. The macro file (omnetpp.dsm) should be copied into the following directory:
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Macros
2. Activate the macro file within the MSVC IDE:
   Tools|Customize --> select Add-ins and Macro Files tab --> in the listbox,
   tick 'omnetpp' item
3. Add icons to the MSVC toolbar:
   Tools|Customize again --> select Commands tab --> from the Category combo,
   select Macros --> addNEDfileToProject should appear in the listbox -->
   drag it to a toolbar --> select icon for it --> close dialog
 
(Steps 1 and 2 are normally done by the OMNeT++ install program.)

AddNedFile macro:
-----------------
Purpose: adds a NED file to the currently open OMNeT++ project. This job
includes adding the NED file with a Custom Build Step (that is, calling nedc)
and adding the corresponding _n.cpp file (which is generated by nedc) to
the project.

Usage:
  click icon --> inputbox appears --> type ned file name --> the macro will
  add it to the project
Possible caveat:
  - the nedc compiler is referred to as 'nedc' in the project file, which
    means the omnetpp bin directrory should be in the path. Or, you can
    substitute the full path of nedc (e.g. c:\omnetpp\bin\ned.exe), either
    in the Custom Build Step for the NED files, or by find/replace in
    the dsp file.


OMNeT++ AppWizard for MSVC
==========================

Installation:
Copy the binary (OmnetppWizard.awx) into following directory:
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Template
(This step is done automatically by the OMNet++ install program.)

Usage:
  Start MSVC, select File|New... from the menu, choose "OMNeT++
  AppWizard" from the list. Then enjoy...

Tested with MSVC 6.0, NT4.0.
