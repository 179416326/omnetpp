OMNeT++ Integration Macros (AddNedFile)
=======================================
Installation:
1. The macro file (omnetpp.dsm) should be copied into the following directory:
   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Macros
2. Activate the macro file within the MSVC IDE:
   Tools|Customize --> select Add-ins and Macro Files tab --> in the listbox,
   tick 'omnetpp' item
3. Add icons to the MSVC toolbar:
   Tools|Customize again --> select Commands tab --> from the Category combo,
   select Macros --> addNEDfileToProject should appear in the listbox -->
   drag it to a toolbar --> select icon for it --> close dialog
 
(Steps 1 and 2 should be done by the OMNet++ install program.)

AddNedFile macro:
-----------------
Purpose: adds a NED file to the currently open OMNeT++ project. This job
includes adding the NED file with a Custom Build Step (that is, calling nedc)
and adding the corresponding _n.cpp file (which is generated by nedc) to
the project.

Usage:
  click icon --> inputbox appears --> type ned file name --> the macro will
  add it to the project
Possible caveats:
  - the macro occasionally crashes the Scripting Host program and MSVC :-(
    (very remarkable from a Visual Basic macro, isn't it?)
  - the nedc compiler is referred to as 'nedc' in the project file, which
    means the omnetpp bin directrory should be in the path. Or, you can
    substitute the full path of nedc (e.g. c:\omnetpp\bin\ned.exe), either
    in the Custom Build Step for the NED files, or by find/replace in
    the dsp file.


OMNeT++ AppWizard for MSVC
==========================

Installation:
Copy the binary (OmnetppWizard.awx) into following directory:
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\Common\MSDev98\Template
(This step should be done by the OMNet++ install program.)

Usage:
  Select start MSVC, select File|New... from the menu, choose "OMNeT++
  AppWizard" from the list. Then enjoy...

Tested with MSVC 6.0, NT4.0.

Todo:
- add pictures
- make separate source file group in the project tree for NED files
- add this notice: "The warning when loading the project for the first time
  can be ignored"
- add option: [ ] include sample code in generated sources
- add copyright statement (GPL)
