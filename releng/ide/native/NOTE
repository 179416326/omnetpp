- on Linux -static-libstdc++ should be added to LDFLAGS to avoid binary dependency on GLIBCXX which can cause issues with old systems
- For windows 
  o you should use the mingw cross compiler (x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++)
  o Additionally you MUST add the -mthreads option to both CFLAGS and LDFLAGS otherwise the resulting lib will CRASH.
  o you should add the include path the the JDK include files manually (they should be present somewhere in the docker
    build image so cross compilation will work.)
