Important
~~~~~~~~~
If you use OMNeT++ for your research and happen to publish the results in some 
form, please include a reference to OMNeT++ and let me know.

In any case, if you find OMNeT++ useful for your work, I'd be more than happy
learn about that.

What you'll find in the OMNeT++ directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you installed the source distribution, the omnetpp directory on your system
should contain the following subdirectories. (If you installed a precompiled
distribution, some of the directories may be missing, or there might be
additional directories, e.g. containing software bundled with OMNeT++.)

The simulation system itself:

omnetpp/              OMNeT++ root directory
   bin/               OMNeT++ executables (GNED, nedc, etc.)
   include/           simulation kernel header files for models
   lib/               library files
   bitmaps/           icons that can be used in network graphics
   doc/               manual (PDF), readme, license, etc.
       html/          manual in HTML
       api/           API reference in HTML

       cmdenv/        command-line user interface
       tkenv/         Tcl/Tk-based user interface
       nedxml/        NED parser/generator, C++ code generator, XML, etc.
       gned/          graphical NED editor
       plove/         output vector analyzer and plotting tool
       utils/         makefile-autocreator etc
   test/              regression tests for the simulation kernel

There is a tutorial, contributed by Nick van Foreest:

omnetpp/
   tutorial/          the tutorial document
       queues/        sample simulation that supports the tutorial
       doc_src/       the Latex sources for the tutorial doc

Sample simulations are within the samples directory.
Each of the sample directories contain a network description
(.ned file) and corresponding simple module code  (.h, .cc files).
Makefiles and project files are included.

omnetpp/
   samples/           directories for sample simulations
       aloha/         models the Aloha protocol
       cqn/           Closed Queueing Network
       ...

Some tools to make it easier using MSVC with OMNeT++.

omnetpp/
   msvc/
       appwizard/     Custom AppWizard for Visual Studio (appears in File|New)
       macros/        macros like AddNEDFileToProject

There is also material contributed by people in the OMNeT++ community.
Contributed material falls under a different license from that of OMNeT++
(usually GPL).

omnetpp/
   contrib/
       emacs/         NED syntax highlight for GNU Emacs
       octave/        using Octave with OMNeT++


The example programs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example programs are designed to demonstrate as many of the features of
OMNeT++ as possible. (See README file in samples/ for more info.)
We recommend the following order to try them out:
      nim - fifo1 - token - hist - hcube - dyna - fifo2 - fddi
It's best to begin by running Demo, which is a tour of the other sample
simulations.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're installing from a source distribution, please read one of the
following files for instructions, depending on your OS and compiler:
   Readme.Unix    -- generic Unix/Linux
   Readme.Cygwin  -- Cygwin on Windows
   Readme.MSVC    -- Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 on NT (or W2K or XP)
For the first two, the process is not much different from the normal GNU build
and install procedure, except that you may need to edit the configure.user file
manually.

I'm indebted to György Pongor for supporting my OMNeT++-related work at the
university in many different ways, from organizing students to work on parts of
OMNeT++ to providing web and ftp space at the university (although I'm no longer
affiliated). Also, the original (1992) design of OMNeT++ was largely based on
his Pascal-based simulation package called OMNeT. (The ideas of message passing,
simple and compound modules, topology description language and coroutine-based
programming were all taken over from the original OMNeT.)

I'd like to acknowledge the help and support of several people who contributed
(with providing their opinions, sending bug reports/fixes, etc.) to making
OMNeT++ better and more useful for the Internet community: Richard Lyon,
Joel Sherrill, Nimrod Mesika, Dan Talayco, Y. Ahmet Sekercioglu, Brent Weech,
Ulrich Kaage, Balazs Kelemen, Alan Kennington, Niko De Bruyne, Mark Rahner,
Robert Boxall, Kontogiannis Theophanis, Dario Mariani and many others.

Thanks for Eric Wu (team of Y. Ahmet Sekercioglu, Monash University, Au.)
for creating and contributing the MPI-based parallel simulation support!

I'd also like to thank John Ousterhout and other developers for Tcl and Tk
which proved to be an extemely productive environment to build user interfaces;
to D. Richard Hipp for tree.tcl that served as a base for the tree widget in
GNED, and to Victor Wagner for balloon.tcl.

Thanks to Justin Frankel at Nullsoft for creating NSIS, the Nullsoft Installer,
which is extremely handy for creating installers on Windows. NSIS is small,
fast, flexible, and does its job very well.
