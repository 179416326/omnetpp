What's New
==========

In the OMNeT++ 2.0 version (Sep 1999)
-------------------------------------

License conditions have been alleviated: from this release on, one can elect
to use GPL for the base components of OMNeT++.

The configure script has been replaced by GNU Autoconf. The makefiles have been 
brushed up (more standard symbol names, autodepend, version number in lib names,
etc). Cygwin is now fully supported. DOS+BC3.1 support has been removed for
lack of interest. File names longer than 8+3 are now used within the package.

Most of the effort since the last release was put into GNED. As a result,
GNED can now directly read/write NED files, so you can use it to work on your
existing NED sources. Moreover, GNED is now a fully two-way tool: you can edit
compound modules in graphic or in NED source form, and switch to the other view
any time. The GUI has been improved too: toolbar icons, tooltips, NED syntax
highlight. GNED is still in beta and there's some missing functionality.

Tkenv's user interface has also undergone some beautifying and bugfixing:
now it has toolbar icons, tooltips, etc.

OMNETPP_BITMAP_PATH can now contain a list of directories; it includes "." and
"./bitmaps" by default, so individual simulation models can have their own
icons in their own directories.

Smaller enhancements were made to the simulation library. Some of them are:
dynamic simple modules can now be created and booted in one step by using
cModuleType's createInitStart() function; callInitialize() and callFinish()
was added to the module classes (for compound modules they work recursively);
behavior of cancelEvent() slightly changed; cMessage now has an isScheduled()
member function.

See the ChangeLog in the directory of the individual components for details
on what has been changed/fixed/improved. 

Contributions have been added. They include NED syntax highlight for Emacs,
and recipes and sample code to use Octave with OMNeT++.

Which is less visible to you, the development has moved to use CVS.


In version of Feb, 1999 (OMNeT++ 1.1)
-------------------------------------

handleMessage() support added as alternative to activity(). Finite
State Machines (FSMs) are now also supported. They are demonstrated
in the fifo2 sample simulation.

The cPacket class and the protocol.h header was added; its aim is
to standardize on protocol models. Negative message kind values
are now reserved.

Added contributed howto about using OMNeT++ on NT with CYGWIN. Also
added contributed report on using message subclassing.

The way of writing custom inspectors has been redesigned to make it
more flexible. Also, Tkenv now has a plugin interface.

Several bugfixes and smaller improvements: Tkenv message inspector
redesigned; bugs in the ini file reader and the statistics classes
were fixed; vsscanf() was eliminated; the makefiles are now created
from makefile.in files; wait(), receive() and surroundings were
optimized; bug in GNED bug fixed etc.


In version of Aug, 1998 (OMNeT++ 1.0)
-------------------------------------

Data collection by output vectors can be configured in the ini file
(ie. OPNET 'probes'). Display strings can now be specified in the ini file
as an alternative to embedding them in ned files.

GNED has been totally rewritten. Now it supports colors, icon selection
etc. and correctly generates display strings. Cut/copy/paste capability.

A models/support library added with several base/utility classes and modules.

Ported to Windows 95/NT. Borland C++ 5.0 project files are included.

Numerous smaller improvements on Plove and Tkenv. Possibility 
to make standalone simulation executables with Tkenv's TCL script 
parts compiled into the executable.

To-do list and coding conventions (style guide) has been added to the 
docs; please stick to it. Tkenv is now better documented; and so is the 
cKSplit class.

As usually, additions and changes in the User Manual are marked with 
(new) in the text. It does not necessarily mean the feature documented 
there is new; most probably only the documentation is.

As usually, you're welcome to hack on the code and send in patches! 
GNED is a very good target to start at. If you plan to do development,
you can sign up on the OMNeT++ mailing list and exchange ideas with 
others.


In version of July, 1998
------------------------

Documentation now includes quickstart reference for OPNET users. 
Additions to the User Manual are marked with (new!) in the text.

Tkenv has been improved significantly. Better animation: message names 
are displayed and message kind is color-coded. New connection inspector 
shows a connection path graphically. Module inspector has been redesigned 
in notepad-style. Right-click popup menus in inspector windows.
Variables can be changed at run-time by cWatch inspectors. You can now 
use the menu and play with the inspectors while simulation is running. 
Several smaller improvements.

Routing support through the cTopology class. Other new classes are 
cWeightedStdDev, cLinkedList. Direct message encapsulation support. 
cPar can now store void* pointers. Output scalar file added which 
accumulates results from several simulation runs. Several refinements 
on the class library, more informative error messages. 

Improved makemake script supports large models which span across 
multiple directories. Plove made more intuitive with mc-like key bindings 
and right-click popup menus.


In version of June 5, 1998
--------------------------

Documentation now comes also in HTML. We now have an LSM entry.

Tkenv made the default user interface.

Network graphics (module icons, connection arrows etc) and message
flow animation has been added to Tkenv. Usefulness of Tkenv dramatically
improved. Default graphics for models originally written without
graphics (no modifications needed).

By default, libraries are now dynamically linked which drastically reduces
executable sizes. You can revert to static linking by editing in `configure'.
You can load shared objects (e.g simple module code) at run-time
(-l command-line option).

Source directory tree changed to be more 'unix-like'.

New histogram class with user-defined and equal-frequency cells added
(thanks to Gabor Lencse), existing ones cleaned up and significantly
enhanced.

Wildcards (*,?) can be used in omnetpp.ini to supply values to several
model parameters at a time. Ini file inclusion and multiple ini files
support (via multiple -f command-line options) added. Total stack size 
for the coroutines can now be given in the omnetpp.ini file.

Several bug fixes and minor improvements on Plove, GNED etc.


Version of May, 1998
--------------------
Has not been publicly announced.


In version of March, 1998
-------------------------

An new interactive tool, Plove has been added. Plove is for analyzing
and plotting output vector files. Plove uses gnuplot to do the actual
work. In addition to viewing, you can save the gnuplot graphs to files
(postscript, latex, pbm etc) with a click. Filtering the results
before plotting (averaging, truncation, smoothing, etc) is possible.
Some filters are built in, and you can easily create new filters or
modify the existing ones.

Portability: Unix and (with some limitations) Win95/NT


In version of February, 1998
----------------------------

Type checking has been added to the NED language and the compiler.
New operators have also been added (like binary and/or/xor, shifting etc).

Now it is not necessary to declare module parameters and gates in .cc files
(Module..End stuff can be left out).

A new example program, HCube was added. It simulates an arbitrary-size
hypercube network with a simple deflection routing.

A configur script was added that -- on Unix platforms -- finds the
installation directories of Tcl/Tk, X, PVM and Turbo Vision, and
customizes the makefiles accordingly.

The Jar compiler has been renamed to NEDC because the name 'Jar' was
used by other software (a DOS archiver; Java tar on Solaris etc.)

Some scripts in util/ have also been renamed.

Now it is possible to specify values with time units (s,ms,us,m,h,d etc.)
in omnetpp.ini.

Misc improvements: some bugs fixed; some error messages in the sim. kernel
made more informative etc.


In version of December, 1997
----------------------------

A graphical model editor (GNED) is here. It's written entirely in Tcl/Tk.
Try it. It is the first, simple version; there's more to come.

The way of defining simple modules has been simplified a lot. Check out the
manual or see the example programs!

A new example program (fifo) was added that models a single-server queue and
also demonstrates how to derive a simple module from another one.

Important: the [All runs] ini file section has been renamed to [Parameters] to
reduce misunderstandings.


In version of October 15, 1997
------------------------------

Several member functions (and even classes) have been renamed for the sake
of a more readable code as well as consistency in naming and style. The utils
directory contains a Unix script (convert) to upgrade your files.

The cKSplit class was added -- another, experimental on-line distribution
approximation method.

Several bugfixes and improvements, updated manual.

The arg.list to the constructor of the histogram classes has changed --
beware, the compiler might not warn you!


In version of September 15, 1997
--------------------------------

Tkenv has been developed upon a lot -- try it with the improved Token Ring
example!

Parallel execution via PVM has been tested and significantly improved.
Syncpoints (a tool for synchronization) were added. See the user manual
for details. Go ahead and do Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES)
with OMNeT++!

The implementation of the message queue (Future Event Set) has become more
efficient: the underlying data structure has been changed to heap.

Most important change in the simulation class library: cQueue's interface
has changed. See the manual or the source code.

Most important change in the ini file: The [General]/number-of-runs option
has been replaced by the [Cmdenv]/runs-to-execute option and the
-r command-line switch.

Check the version.log files for the numerous other changes. Many bugfixes
and code cleanups were made.

Refman.doc is out of date, sorry! I'll try to catch up.
