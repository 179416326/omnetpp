Experimental message subclassing is currently documented in src/nedc/msgdoc.txt. 

The message subclassing compiler is src/nedc/msgc.pl; msgtest.ned in the same
directory is an example NED file that you can try to get an impression what
the whole thing is about.

To try message subclassing, you have to re-run configure with the
   --enable-nedc-subcl
command-line argument.

samples/dyna2 demonstrates the use if message subclassing.

Sorry, there's currently no support for this stuff -- use at your own risk
if you find it useful!
