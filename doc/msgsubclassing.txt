Experimental message subclassing is currently documented in src/nedc/msgdoc.txt. 

The message subclassing compiler is src/nedc/msgc.pl; msgtest.ned in the same
directory is an example NED file that you can try to get an impression what
the whole thing is about.

Sorry, there's currently no support for this stuff -- use at your own risk
if you find it useful!
