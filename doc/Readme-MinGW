Installing OMNeT++ on Windows/MinGW
===================================

For detailed, platform specific installation instructions please
read the InstallGuide.pdf file under the 'doc' directory.

1. Installing OMNeT++

Download the OMNeT++ source code from the omnetpp.org site. Make sure
you select to download the Windows-specific archive, named
omnetpp-<version>-src-windows.zip.

The package is nearly self-contained: it includes a C++ compiler and
a build environment, and all libraries and programs required by OMNeT++.

The only package that you need to download and install separately is
the Java runtime (JRE), version 5.0 or later; please download it
from http://java.sun.com and install it before proceeding.

Copy the OMNeT++ archive to the directory where you want to install it.
Be sure that the path to the directory does NOT contain any space.
Extract the archive using the command:

    unzip omnetpp-<version>-src-windows.zip

A subdirectory called omnetpp-<version> will be created. It contains
the simulator files, and a full MSYS/MinGW installation customized for
OMNeT++.

Start mingwenv.cmd. It will bring up a bash shell, where the the path is
already set to include the omnetpp-<version>/bin directory. If you want
to start OMNeT++ simulations from Windows Explorer, please add the
omnetpp-<version>/bin directory to your system path.

First, check the configure.user to make sure it contains the settings
you need. In most cases you don't need to change anything:
    notepad configure.user

Then the usual GNU-like stuff:
    ./configure
    make

This will create both debug and release binaries.

You should now test all samples and check they run correctly. As an example,
the dyna example is started by entering the following commands:

    cd samples/dyna
    ./dyna

By default the samples will run using the Tcl/Tk environment. You should see
nice gui windows and dialogs.

2. Starting the IDE

OMNeT++ 4.0 comes with an Eclipse-based Simulation IDE. You will need at least
Java Runtime Environment 5.0 installed on your machine.  You should be able
to start the IDE by typing:

    omnetpp

NOTE: The IDE is supported on the following platforms:
 - Windows 32bit
 - Linux 32/64bit (i386)
 - Mac OS X 10.5/6 (i386)

3. Reconfiguring the libraries

If you need to recompile the OMNeT++ components with different flags (e.g.
different optimization), then change the top-level omnetpp directory, edit
configure.user accordingly, then say:

    ./configure
    make clean
    make

If you want to recompile just a single library, then change to the directory
of the library (e.g. cd src/sim) and type:

    make clean
    make

By default, libraries are compiled in both debug and release mode. If you want
to make release or debug builds only, use:

    make MODE=release

or

    make MODE=debug

By default, shared libraries will be created. If you want to build static
libraries, use:

    make SHARED_LIBS=no

NOTE: The built libraries and programs are immediately copied
to the lib/ and bin/ subdirs.


4. Portability issues

OMNeT++ has been tested with the MinGW gcc compiler. The current distribution
contains gcc 4.2.1 version.

Microsoft Visual C++ is not supported in the Academic Edition.
