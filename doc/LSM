Description:    OMNeT++ is a C++-based discrete event simulator. Graphical
                model editor, powerful textual model topology description
                language, C++ simulation class library, process-based
                activity description (uses coroutines), multiple run-time
                user interfaces (batch, graphical, TVision), message flow and
                statistics animation, interactive simulation, tracing,
                random seed generator tool, result analysis and
                plotting tool, support for parallel execution via PVM.
                Sample simulations include FDDI, Token Ring, deflection
                routing in hypercube etc. Ported to Windows NT.
