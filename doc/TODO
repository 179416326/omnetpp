Further plans
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Updated: March 2002


regression tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
test cases should cover the whole sim kernel and nedc

NED II
~~~~~~
finalize and implement NED II (draft on web site)
refine support for message subclassing


improve the simulation core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
on win32, use the fibers api
more cleanup
realtime scheduler (for hw-in-the-loop simulation)
proper connection objects
more flexible connections
multi-thread simple modules
--
bidirectional gates (?)
propagate state info over connections ("statistic wires") (?)


develop GNED
~~~~~~~~~~~~
see GNED's TODO file


foundations towards a consistent model library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
package structure

make a library of abstract models: abstract queue, bus, router,
application packet dispatcher, transport protocol abstraction etc.
They could serve as skeletons for development (one could use them
by deriving new simple module classes from them).

conventions for development of protocol models so that
models models from different people can directly work together:
message passing conventions, conventions on message parameter names,
module gate names etc.


add more simulation models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ask people to contribute models
maintain a repository for contributed models/utilities
