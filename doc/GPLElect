Using the GPL for certain components of OMNeT++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of using the original license, you may instead elect to use
the GNU General Public License (GPL) for a particular copy of certain
components of OMNeT++. The "License" file lists the components that are
eligible for this. The election to use the GPL is irrevocable for that
particular copy. If you do elect to use the GPL, then you must replace
the copyright notice on each affected file with the following:

You must change the "README" and "License" files to say that an election
has been made to use this copy under the GPL. If you redistribute OMNeT++,
you should also include a copy of the GPL.

Note that I will probably not accept patches under terms that allow
me to distribute them only under the GPL.
