This file describes the license conditions of using OMNeT++. As an alternative,
you may elect to use the GNU General Public License instead of this License
for a particular copy of OMNeT++. The "GPLElect" file describes how to
technically perform the election.

OMNeT++ (the "Software") is distributed in the hope that it will be
useful. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Software
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy the appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

The Software can be freely used for non-profit use, including personal,
educational and research non-profit use. If you want to use the Software
in commercial projects or you want to include it in commercial products
in any form, you must obtain a license from the author before doing so.

You may modify your copy of the Software or any portion of it, but you
may not redistribute the modified version. If you want your modifications
to be incorporated into the Software or distribute a modified version of
the Software, you must contact the authors.

The sources of simulation models and the simulation results produced using
the Software and extensions to the Software are naturally not covered by
this License.

You may distribute simulation models in binary form which contain OMNeT++
libraries if doing so otherwise complies to this License (esp. see clause
about non-profit use), otherwise you must obtain a license from the author
before doing so.

If you use OMNeT++ in any work, the resulting document(s) (report, paper,
article, book, etc.) should contain a reference to the Software and its
authors.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR DISTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE TO ANY PARTY
