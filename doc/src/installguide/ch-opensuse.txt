=== Supported Releases

This chapter provides additional information for installing @OMNETPP@ on
openSUSE installations. The overall installation procedure is described
in the 'Linux' chapter.

The following openSUSE releases are covered:

* openSUSE 12.2

They were tested on the following architectures:

* Intel 32-bit and 64-bit

=== Opening a Terminal

Choose 'Applications > System > Terminal > Terminal' from the menu.

=== Installing the Prerequisite Packages

You can perform the installation using the graphical user interface or
from the terminal, whichever you prefer.

==== Command-Line Installation

To install the required packages, type in the terminal:

  $ sudo zypper install make gcc gcc-c++ bison flex perl \
      tcl-devel tk-devel libxml2-devel zlib-devel \
      java-1_6_0-openjdk doxygen graphviz openmpi-devel libpcap-devel \
      mozilla-xulrunner192

then follow the instruction on the console.

Note that 'openmpi' will not be available by default, first you need to
log out and log in again, or source your `.profile` script:

  $ . ~/.profile

[NOTE]
===============================================================
OpenSUSE provides no BLT package, so it is missing from the above list.
BLT is optional in @OMNETPP@ and its absence will not result in loss
of functionality, but you can download a BLT source package from sourceforge.net,
and compile and install it yourself if you wish. See the 'Generic Unix'
chapter of this Installation Guide for more information on BLT.
===============================================================
