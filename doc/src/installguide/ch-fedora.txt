== Fedora 18

=== Supported Releases

This chapter provides additional information for installing @OMNETPP@ on
Fedora installations. The overall installation procedure is described
in the 'Linux' chapter.

The following Fedora release is covered:

* Fedora 18

It was tested on the following architectures:

* Intel 32-bit and 64-bit

=== Opening a Terminal

Choose 'Applications > System Tools > Terminal' from the menu.

=== Installing the Prerequisite Packages

You can perform the installation using the graphical user interface or
from the terminal, whichever you prefer.

==== Command-Line Installation

To install the required packages, type in the terminal:

  $ su -c 'yum install make gcc gcc-c++ bison flex perl \
      tcl-devel tk-devel blt libxml2-devel zlib-devel \
      java doxygen graphviz webkitgtk openmpi-devel libpcap-devel'

then follow the instruction on the console.

Note that 'openmpi' will not be available by default, it needs to be
activated in every session with the

  $ module load openmpi-<arch>

command, where `<arch>` is your architecture (usually `i386` or `x86_64`).
When in doubt, use `module avail` to display the list of available
modules. If you need MPI in every session, you may add the `module load`
command to your startup script (`.bashrc`).

==== Graphical Installation

The graphical installer can be launched by choosing
'System > Administration > Add/Remove Software' from the menu.
