== Fedora 25

=== Supported Releases

This chapter provides additional information for installing @OMNETPP@ on
Fedora installations. The overall installation procedure is described
in the 'Linux' chapter.

The following Fedora release is covered:

* Fedora 25

It was tested on the following architectures:

* Intel 64-bit

=== Opening a Terminal

Open the Search bar, and type 'Terminal'.

=== Installing the Prerequisite Packages

You can perform the installation using the graphical user interface or
from the terminal, whichever you prefer.

==== Command-Line Installation

To install the required packages, type in the terminal:

  $ sudo dnf install make gcc gcc-c++ bison flex perl \
      tcl-devel tk-devel qt5-devel libxml2-devel zlib-devel \
      java doxygen graphviz webkitgtk

To use 3D visualization support in Qtenv, you should install
OpenSceneGraph 3.2 or later and osgEarth 2.7 or later (recommended):

  $ sudo dnf install OpenSceneGraph-devel osgearth-devel

[NOTE]
=====================================================
You may opt to use clang and clang++ instead of the gcc and g++ compilers.
=====================================================

To enable the optional parallel simulation support you will need to install the
MPI package:

  $ sudo dnf install openmpi-devel

Note that 'openmpi' will not be available by default, it needs to be
activated in every session with the

  $ module load mpi/openmpi-x86_64

command. When in doubt, use `module avail` to display the list of available
modules. If you need MPI in every session, you may add the `module load`
command to your startup script (`.bashrc`).

==== PCAP

The optional Pcap library allows simulation models to capture and
transmit network packets bypassing the operating system's protocol stack.
It is not used directly by @OMNETPP@, but models may need it to support
network emulation.

==== Graphical Installation

The graphical package manager can be launched by opening the Search bar
and typing 'dnf'.

Search for the following packages in the list. Select the checkboxes
in front of the names, and pick the latest version of each package.

The packages:

* make, bison, gcc, gcc-c++, flex, perl, tcl-devel, tk-devel, qt5-devel, libxml2-devel,
zlib-devel, webkitgtk, java, doxygen, graphviz, openmpi-devel, libpcap-devel,
OpenSceneGraph-devel, osgearth-devel

Click 'Apply', then follow the instructions.
