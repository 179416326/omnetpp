== Ubuntu

=== Supported Releases

This chapter provides additional information for installing @OMNETPP@ on
Ubuntu Linux installations. The overall installation procedure is described
in the 'Linux' chapter.

The following Ubuntu releases are covered:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 13.04

They were tested on the following architectures:

* Intel 32-bit and 64-bit

The instructions below assume that you use the Gnome desktop and the bash shell,
which are the defaults. If you use another desktop environment or shell,
you may need to adjust the instructions accordingly.


=== Opening a Terminal

Type 'terminal' in Dash and click on the Terminal icon.

=== Installing the Prerequisite Packages

You can perform the installation using the graphical user interface or
from the terminal, whichever you prefer.

==== Command-Line Installation

Before starting the installation, refresh the database of available packages.
Type in the terminal:

  $ sudo apt-get update

To install the required packages, type in the terminal:

 $ sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc g++ bison flex perl \
       tcl-dev tk-dev blt libxml2-dev zlib1g-dev default-jre \
       doxygen graphviz libwebkitgtk-1.0-0 openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev libpcap-dev

At the confirmation questions ('Do you want to continue? [Y/N]'), answer 'Y'.

==== Graphical Installation

Ubuntu's graphical installer, 'Synaptic', can be started
with the 'System > Administration > Synaptic package manager' menu item.

Since software installation requires root permissions, Synaptic will ask you
to type your password.

Search for the following packages in the list, click the squares before the names,
then choose 'Mark for installation' or 'Mark for upgrade'.

If the 'Mark additional required changes?' dialog comes up, choose the 'Mark' button.

The packages:

* build-essential, gcc, g++, bison, flex, perl, tcl-dev, tk-dev, blt, libxml2-dev,
zlib1g-dev, default-jre, doxygen, graphviz, libwebkitgtk-1.0-0, openmpi-bin,
libopenmpi-dev, libpcap-dev

Click 'Apply', then in the 'Apply the following changes?' window, click 'Apply' again.
In the 'Changes applied' window, click 'Close'.


==== Post-Installation Steps

The default tooltip background color in Ubuntu is black, which causes certain tooltips
in the @OMNETPP@ IDE to become unreadable (black-on-black). This annoyance can be resolved
by changing the tooltip colors in Ubuntu.

Install 'gnome-color-chooser':

 $ sudo apt-get install gnome-color-chooser

Run it:

 $ gnome-color-chooser

Find the 'Tooltips' group on the 'Specific' tab, and change the settings to black foreground over
pale yellow background. Click Apply.
