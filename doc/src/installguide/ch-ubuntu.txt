This chapter provides additional information for installing @OMNETPP@ on

in the 'Linux' chapter.

The following Ubuntu releases are covered:

They were tested on the following architectures:

* Intel 32-bit and 64-bit

The instructions below assume that you use the Gnome desktop and the bash shell,
which are the defaults. If you use another desktop environment or shell,
you may need to adjust the instructions accordingly.


=== Opening a Terminal

Choose 'Applications > Accessories > Terminal' from the menu.

This only applies if you use the Gnome Desktop (default).

=== Installing the Prerequisite Packages

You can perform the installation using the graphical user interface or
from the terminal, whichever you prefer.

==== Command-Line Installation

Before starting the installation, refresh the database of available packages.
Type in the terminal:

  $ sudo apt-get update

==== Graphical Installation

Ubuntu's graphical installer, 'Synaptic', can be started
with the 'System > Administration > Synaptic package manager' menu item.

Since software installation requires root permissions, Synaptic will ask you
to type your password.

Search for the following packages in the list, click the squares before the names,
then choose 'Mark for installation' or 'Mark for upgrade'.

If the 'Mark additional required changes?' dialog comes up, choose the 'Mark' button.

The packages:

* build-essential, gcc, g++, bison, flex, perl, tcl-dev, tk-dev, blt, libxml2-dev,
zlib1g-dev, openjdk-6-jre, doxygen, graphviz, openmpi-bin, libopenmpi-dev, libpcap-dev
