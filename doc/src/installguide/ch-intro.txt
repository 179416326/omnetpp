The Simulation IDE can be used on the following platforms:

* Windows 7, Vista, XP (32-bit)
* Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 (32-bit)

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
Simulations can be run practically on any unix-like environment with
a decent and fairly up-to-date C++ compiler, for example gcc 4.x. Certain
@OMNETPP@ features (Tkenv, parallel simulation, XML support, etc.) depend
on the availability of external libraries (Tcl/Tk, MPI, LibXML or Expat,
etc.)

IDE platforms are restricted because the IDE relies on a native shared
library, which we compile for the above platforms and distribute
in binary form for convenience.
