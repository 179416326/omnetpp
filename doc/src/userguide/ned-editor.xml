  <title>Editing NED Files</title>
  <sect1>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>
      When you double-click a [[.ned]] file in the IDE, it will open in the NED editor.
      The new NED editor is a dual-mode editor: in the graphical mode you can edit the network using the
      mouse, and the textual mode allows you to work directly on the NED source.
    </para>
    <para>
      The syntax of NED files has changed significantly from the 3.x version.
      The NED editor primarily supports the new syntax: it is still possible
      to read and display NED files with the old syntax, many of the advanced features, however (syntax
      highlighting, content assistance, etc.), will not work. There is automatic conversion from the old syntax
      to the new, available both from the NED editor and as an external utility program (
      <command>nedtool</command>
      ).
    </para>
    <para>
      The
      <command>gned</command>
      program from &Omnetpp;
      3.x viewed NED files in isolation. In contrast, the &Omnetpp;
      IDE gathers information from all [[.ned]] files in all open &Omnetpp;
      projects, and makes this information available to the NED editor. This is necessary because in &Omnetpp;
      4.0, modules may inherit parameters, visual appearance or even submodules and connections from other
      modules, so it is only possible to display a compound module correctly if all related NED definitions
      are available.
    </para>
    <para> When the IDE detects errors in a NED file, the problem will be flagged with an error marker in the
      ``Project Explorer'', and the ``Problems View'' will be updated to show the description and location of the
      problem. Also error markers will appear in the text window or on the graphical representation of the
      problematic component. Opening a NED file which contains an error will open the file in text mode.
      Switching to graphical mode is possible only if the NED file is syntactically correct.
    </para>
    <note>
      As a side effect, currently if there are two modules with the same name and package in related projects,
      they will collide, and both will be marked with an error. Furthermore, the name will be treated as undefined,
      and any other modules depending on it will also generate an error. (Thus, a "no such module type" error
      may mean that actually there are more than one definitions which nullify each other.)

  <sect1>
    <title>Creating new NED files</title>
    <para>
      Once you have an empty &Omnetpp;
      project, you can create new NED files. Choosing ``File|New|Network Description File'' from the menu will
      bring up a wizard where you can specify the target directory and the file/module name. You may choose to
      create an empty NED file, or a simple/compound module, or a network. Once you press the ``Finish''
      button, a new NED file will be created with the requested content.
      <picture file="pictures/NED-NewWizard.png">Creating a new NED file</picture>
    </para>
    <tip>
      It is a good practice that the NED file and the contained module have the same name. For example, a
      compound module named [[Wireless42]] should be defined within its own [[Wireless42.ned]] file.
    </tip>
    <sect2>
      <title>NED Source Folders</title>
      <para>
        It is possible to specify which folders the IDE should scan for NED files and will use as the base
        directory for your NED package hierarchy. The IDE will not use any NED files outside the specified NED
        Source Folders and those files will be opened in a standard text editor. To specify the directory
        where the NED files will be stored right click on the project in the ``Project Explorer'' and choose
        ``Properties''. Select the ``&Omnetpp; | Ned
        Source Folders'' page and click on the folders where you store your NED files. The default value is the
        project root.

  <sect1>
    <title>Using the NED editor</title>
    <para> If you want to open a NED file, just double-click its icon in the ``Project Explorer''. If the NED file
      can be parsed without an error, the graphical representation of the file will be opened, otherwise
      (errors in the file) the text view will be opened, and the text will be annotated
      with error markers.</para>
    <warning>
      Only files contained in NED Source Folders will be opened with the graphical editor. If a NED file is
      not in the NED Source Folders, it will be opened in a standard text editor.
    </warning>
    <para>
      You can switch between graphical and source editing mode by clicking the tabs at
      the bottom of the editor, or using the
      <keycap>Ctrl+PGUP/PGDN</keycap>
      key combinations. The editor will try to keep the selection during the switch: selecting an element in a
      graphical view and then switching to text view will move the cursor to the related element in the NED
      file. When switching back to graphical view, the graphical editor will try to select the element that
      corresponds to the cursor location in the NED source. This allows you to keep the context even if you
      switch back and forth regularly.
    </para>
    <sect2>
      <title>Editing in graphical mode</title>
      <para> The graphical editor displays the visible elements of the loaded NED file. Simple modules,
        compound modules and networks are represented by figures or icons. Each NED file can contain more than
        one module or network. In that case, the corresponding figures will appear in the same order as they
        are found in the NED file.</para>
      <tip>
        It is a good practice to place only a single module or network into a NED file, and name the file
        according to the module name.
      </tip>
      <para> Simple modules and submodules are represented as icons while compound modules and networks are
        displayed as rectangles where other submodules can be dropped. Connections between submodules are represented
        either by lines or arrows depending whether the connection was uni- or bi-directional. Submodules can
        be dragged or resized by the mouse and connected by using the Connection Tool in the palette.</para>
      <picture file="pictures/NED-GraphEditor.png">Graphical NED Editor</picture>
      <para> The palette is normally at the right of the editor area. The upper part of the palette contains
        the basic tools: selector, connection selector, and the connection creator tool. To use a palette
        item, click it then click into the module where you want to place/activate it. The mouse pointer will give
        you feedback whether the requested operation is allowed. The middle part of the toolbox contains the
        basic elements that can be placed at the top level in a NED file (simple module, compound module,
        interface, channel etc.), and a "generic" submodule. Click on any of these and then click into the
        editor area to create an instance. The bottom part of the palette contains all module types that can
        be instantiated as a submodule. They are shortcuts for creating a generic submodule and then modifying
        its type. They will display the default icon (if any) and a short documentation if you hover the mouse
        over them. You may configure the palette by right clicking on a button and selecting ``Settings...''
        or filter its content by selecting ``Select Packages...''</para>
      <para> Right-clicking any element in the edited NED file will bring up a context menu that allows several
        actions like changing the icon, pinning/unpinning a submodule, re-layouting a compound module, or
        deleting/renaming the element. There are also items to activate various views, for example the
        ``Properties View'' where you can edit properties of the element.</para>
      <para>
        Hovering over an element will display its documentation (the comment in the NED source above the
        definition) in a "tooltip". Pressing
        <keycap>F2</keycap>
        will make the tooltip window persistent, so it can be resized and scrolled for more convenient
        reading.
      </para>
      <sect3>
        <title>Creating modules</title>
        <para> To create a module or a submodule, click on the appropriate palette item, and then click where
          you want to place the new element. Submodules can be placed only inside compound modules or networks,
          while other types can be dropped directly in the editor window.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Creating and changing connections</title>
        <para> Select the ``connection tool'' (if there are channels defined in the project, you can use the
          drop down to select which channel type the connection should have). First click the source module,
          then the destination. A pop-up menu will appear, asking which gates should be connected on the two
          selected modules. The tool will offer only valid connections (for example, it will not offer
          connecting two output gates).</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Reconnecting modules</title>
        <para>Clicking and dragging a connection end point to another module will reconnect it optionally
          asking which gate should be connected. If you want to change only the gate, drag the
          connection end point and drop it over the original module. A popup will appear asking for the source
          or destination gate.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Selecting elements</title>
        <para>
          Selecting an element is done by clicking on it or by dragging out a rectangle over the target modules.
          A compound module can be selected by clicking on its border or title. If you want to select only
          connections within a selection rectangle, use the ``connection selector'' tool in the dropdown menu
          of the ``connection tool'' . The
          <keycap>CTRL</keycap>
          and
          <keycap>SHIFT</keycap>
          key can be used to add/remove to/from the current selection. Note that the keyboard (arrow keys) can
          also be used to navigate between submodules. You can also select using a selection rectangle by
          dragging the mouse around the modules.
        </para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Undo, redo, deleting elements</title>
        <para>
          Use
          <keycap>Ctrl+Z</keycap>
          ,
          <keycap>Ctrl+Y</keycap>
          for undo/redo, and the DEL key for deletion. These functions are also available in the ``Edit'' menu
          and in the context menu of the selected element.
        </para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Moving and resizing elements</title>
        <para>
          You can move/resize the selected elements with the mouse. Holding down
          <keycap>SHIFT</keycap>
          during move will perform a constrained (horizontal, diagonal or vertical) move operation.
          <keycap>CTRL</keycap>
          + resize will resize around the object’s center.
          <keycap>SHIFT</keycap>
          + resize will keep the aspect ratio of the element.
        </para>
        <para> If you turn on ``Snap to Geometry'' in the ``View'' menu, helper lines will appear to allow you
          to align to other modules. Selecting more than one submodule activates the ``Alignment'' menu (found
          both in the ``View'' menu and in the context menu).</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Copying elements</title>
        <para>
          Holding down
          <keycap>CTRL</keycap>
          while dragging will clone the module(s). Copy/Paste can be also used both on single modules and with
          group selection.

      <sect3>
        <title>Zooming</title>
        <para>
          Zooming in and out is possible from the ``View'' menu, or using
          <keycap>Ctrl+-</keycap>
          or
          <keycap>Ctrl+=,</keycap>
          or holding down

      <sect3>
        <title>Pinning and unpinning, re-layouting</title>
        <para> A submodule display string may or may not contain explicit coordinates for the submodule; if it
          does not, then the location of the submodule will be determined by the layouting algorithm. A
          submodule with explicit coordinates is pinned; one without is unpinned. The Pin action inserts the
          current coordinates into the display string, and the Unpin action removes them. Moving a submodule
          also automatically pins it. The position of an unpinned module is undetermined, and may change every
          time the layouting algorithm runs. For convenience, the layouter does not run when a submodule gets
          unpinned (so that the submodule does not jump away on unpinning), but this also means that unpinned
          submodules may appear at different locations next time the same NED file gets opened.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Choosing icon for a module</title>
        <para> To choose an icon for a module right click on it and select the ``Choose an Icon...'' menu item
          from the context menu or select the module and modify the icon property in the ``Properties View''.
        </para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Navigation</title>
        <para> Double-clicking a submodule will open the corresponding module type in a NED editor. Selecting
          an element in the graphical editor and then switching to text mode will place the cursor near the
          previously selected element in the text editor.</para>
        <para> Navigating inside a longer NED file is much easier if you open the ``Outline View'' to see the
          internal structure of the file. Selecting an element in the outline will select the same element in
          the graphical editor.</para>
        <para> If you want to see the selected element in a different view select the element and right click
          on it. Choose ``Show In'' from the context menu and select the desired view.</para>
      </sect3>
      <sect3>
        <title>Opening a NED type</title>
        <para>
          If you know only the name of a type of a module or other NED element, you can use the ``Open NED
          Type'' dialog by pressing
          <keycap>Ctrl+SHIFT+N</keycap>
          . Type the name, or search with wildcards. The requested type will be opened in an editor. This
          feature is not tied to the graphical editor: the Open NED Type dialog is available from anywhere in
          the IDE.

      <sect3>
        <title>Setting properties</title>
        <para>
          Elements of the display string and other properties associated with the selected elements can be
          edited in the ``Properties View''. The property view is grouped and hierarchically organized however
          you can switch off this behavior on the view toolbar. Most properties can be edited directly in the
          view but some has also specific editors that can be activated by pressing the ellipsis button at the
          end of the field. Fields marked with a small light bulb support content assist. Try the
          <keycap>CTRL+SPACE</keycap>
          key combination to get a list of posible values.
