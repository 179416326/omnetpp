<title>Launching or Debugging the Simulation</title>
<p>To quickly launch the simulation, just select tictoc.exe and
open the run dialog as shown in the screen shot.</p>

<p>In the Run Dialog that appears, just select tictoc and select
TictocTest configuration to be launched. Then simply press Run to
see your experiment in action.</p>

<p>Your experiment will be launched in the Tkenv environment,
and you should see information being exchanged between the two
nodes, if you press "play" to start the experiment.</p>

<p>This section was meant to give you a glimpse of how quickly
you can put together a working experiment, despite the power and
complexity of the system. Now let us examine the editor's features
in more detail.</p>

<p>Detail detail detail&gt; TODO</p>

<p>Just as in the NED Editor, the Ini File Editor is also
capable of quickly jumping to the definition of parameters.</p>

<p>For example, Control-Clicking Tictoc6.toc.delayTime in the
omnetpp.ini of the tictoc samples,</p>

<picture file="pictures/4.1.17_CTRL_Click2def.png">TODO</picture>

<p>Results in tictocned6.ned being opened, and the cursor
positioned to the line where delayTime is defined.</p>

<p>&#194;&#160;This feature helps in quickly understanding what
that particular item's intended function is, and where it is
defined, potentially saving a lot of time.</p>
