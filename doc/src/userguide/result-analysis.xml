      Scave is the result analysis tool of OMNeT++, and its task is to help the user
      process and visualize simulation results saved into vector and scalar files. Scave
      is designed so that the user can work equally well on the output of a single
      simulation run (one or two files) and the result of simulation batches (which may be
      several hundred files, possibly in multiple directories). Ad-hoc browsing of the
      data is supported just as well as systematic and repeatable processing. The latter
      means that all processing and charts are stored as "recipes"; for example, if
      simulations need to be re-run due to a model bug or misconfiguration, existing
      charts need not be drawn all over again, but simply replacing the old result files
      with the new ones will result in the charts being automatically displayed with the
      new data.

      While it might be powerful in facilitating quick debugging to view how simulations
      work in the Tkenv environment, in most cases the result of the final simulations
      will be recorded as scalar values (e.g. average load: 75%), or vector values (e.g.
      queue length over time) or histograms. These values will be recorded at the end of
      the simulation as well as during runtime and provide real insight into the scenario
      you are looking at.
    </para>

    <para>
      In OMNEST/OMNeT++ 4.0, statistical analysis becomes a lot more powerful. Not only is
      the statistical analysis tool integrated into the Eclipse environment, your settings
      -- your recipe for finding results from the raw data -- will be recorded in analysis
      files (.anf) and become instantly reproducible. Even if you need to replace some of
      the underlying data in your experiments, you do not need to re-develop the recipe
      (filters, operations, graphs) to squeeze the results you want out of the system.
    </para>

    <para>[from the simutools2008 paper:]</para>

    <para>
      Analyzing the simulation result is a lengthy and time consuming process. In most
      cases the user wants to see the same type of data for each run of the simulation or
      display the same graphs for different modules in the model, so automation is very
      important. (The user does not want to repeat the steps of re-creating charts every
      time simulations have to be re-run for some reason.) The lack of automation support
      drives many users away from existing GUI analysis tools, and forces them to write
      scripts.
    </para>

    <para>
      OMNeT++ solves this by making result analysis rule-based. Simulations and series of
      simulations produce various result files. The user selects the input of the analysis
      by specifying file names or file name patterns (e.g. "adhoc-*.vec"). Data of
      interest can be selected into datasets by further pattern rules. The user completes
      datasets by adding various processing, filtering and charting steps, all using the
      GUI (Figure 7). Whenever the underlying files or their contents change, dataset
      contents and charts are recalculated. The editor only saves the "recipe" and not the
      actual numbers, so when simulations are re-run and so result files get replaced,
      charts are automatically up-to-date. Data in result files are tagged with meta
      information: experiment, measurement and replication labels are added to the result
      files to make the filtering process easy. It is possible to create very
      sophisticated filtering rules, for example, all 802.11 retry counts of host[5..10]
      in experiment X, averaged over replications. In addition datasets can use other
      datasets as their input so datasets can build on each other.

    <title>Creating Analysis Files</title>
    <para>
      To create a new analysis file choose
      <guimenuitem>File|New|Analysis File</guimenuitem> from the menu.
      Select the folder the new file created in and enter the name of the file.
      Press <guibutton>Finish</guibutton> and an empty analysis file is created
      and opened.
    </para>
    <picture file="pictures/ANF-NewAnalysisFileDialog.png">New Analysis File dialog</picture>
    <para>
      There is a quick way to create an analysis file for a result file.
      Just double click on the result file in the Navigator View to open the
      New Analysis File dialog. The folder and file name is filled in according to
      the location and name of the result file. Press <guibutton>Finish</guibutton>
      and a new analysis file created containing the vector and scalar files whose
      names corresponds to the result file. If the name of the result file contained
      a numeric suffix (e.g. aloha-10.vec), then all files with the same prefix added
      the the analysis file (i.e. aloha-*.vec and aloha-*.sca).
    </para>
    
    <tip>
      If the analysis file already exists, double clicking on the result file will open
      it.
    </tip>

  <sect1>
    <title>Using the Analysis Editor</title>

    <para>
      Scave is implemented as a multi-page editor. What the editor edits is the "recipe":
      what result files to take as inputs, what data to select from them, what (optional)
      processing to apply, and what kind of charts to create from them. The pages (tabs)
      of the editor roughly correspond to these steps. You will see that Scave is much
      more than just a union of the OMNeT++ 3.x Scalars and Plove tools.
    </para>

      <title>Input files</title>
      
      <sect3>
        <title>Selecting input files</title>
        
        <para>
          The first page displays the result files that serve as input to the analysis. The
          upper half specifies what files to select, by explicit filenames or by wildcards.
          New input files can be added to the analysis by dragging vector and scalar files
          from the Outline View, or by opening dialogs with the <guibutton>Add File...</guibutton> or
          <guibutton>Wildcard...</guibutton>
          buttons. If the file name is absolute (starts with '/') it is interpreted relative
          to the workspace root, otherwise it is relative to the folder of the analysis
          file.
        </para>
  
        <picture file="pictures/ANF-InputsPage.png">
          Specifying input files for data analysis
        </picture>
  
        <para>
          The input files are loaded when the analysis file is opened. When the file changed
          on the disk it is reloaded automatically when the workspace is refreshed. (It done
          by Eclipse if "General|Workspace|Refresh automatically" option is turned on in the
          Preferences.) Vector files are not loaded directly, but an index file created and
          the vectors data (name, module, statistics...) are loaded from the index file.
          The index files are generated during the simulation, but can be safely deleted
          without loss of information. If the index file is missing or the vector file was
          modified then the IDE rebuilds the index in the background.
        </para>
        
        <tip>The Progress View displays the progress of the indexing process.</tip>
        
        <para>
          The lower half shows what files actually matched the input specification, and what
          runs they contain. Note that OMNeT++ 4.0 result files contain a unique run ID and
          several metadata annotations in addition to the actual recorded data. The third
          tree organizes simulation runs runs according to their
          experiment-measurement-replication labels.
        </para>
  
        <para>
          The underlying assumption is that users will organize their simulation-based
          research into various /experiments/. An experiment will consist of several
          /measurements/, which are typically (but not necessarily) simulations done with
          the same model but with different parameter settings; that is, the user will
          explore the parameter space with several simulation runs. And, to gain statistical
          confidence in the results, each measurement will be possibly repeated several
          times, with different random number seeds. It is easy to set up such scenarios
          with the improved ini files of OMNeT++ 4.0, and then the
          experiment-measurement-replication labels will be assigned more-or-less
          automatically -- please refer to the chapter "Configuring simulations TBD check"
          in the manual) for more discussion.
        </para>

      <para>
        The second page of the Analysis editor displays results (vectors, scalars and
        histograms) from all files in tables, and lets the user browse them. Results can
        be sorted and filtered. Simple filtering is possible with combo boxes, or when
        that's not enough, the user can write arbitrarily complex filters using a generic
        pattern matching expression language. Selected or filtered data can be immediately
        plotted, or remembered in named datasets for further processing.
      </para>

          Usual tree editing operations work on the Dataset tree. New elements can be
          added by dragging elements from the toolbar on the right of the page to the
          appropriate place of the tree. Alternatively you can select the parent node and
          press the button on the toolbar. Existing element can be edited by selecting the
          element and editing its properties on the property sheet or opening an item specific
          edit dialog by choosing <guimenuitem>Properties...</guimenuitem> from the context menu.

          Filters can be applied to the data by adding Apply/Compute items to the dataset.
          The data items to which the filter should be applied can be selected by adding
          Select/Deselect children to the processing node. By default the filter applied
          to each data item. The difference between Apply and Compute is that Apply will
          remove its input from the dataset, while Compute keeps the original data too.
