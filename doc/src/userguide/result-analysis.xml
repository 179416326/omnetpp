<title>Analyzing the Results</title>
<sect1>
<title>Overview</title>
<p>While it might be powerful in facilitating quick debugging to
view how simulations work in the Tkenv environment, in most cases
the result of the final simulations will be recorded as scalar
values (e.g. average load: 75%), or vector values (e.g. queue
length over time) or histograms. These values will be recorded at
the end of the simulation as well as during runtime and provide
real insight into the scenario you are looking at.</p>

<p>In OMNEST/OMNeT++ 4.0, statistical analysis becomes a lot
more powerful. Not only is the statistical analysis tool integrated
into the Eclipse environment, your settings -- your recipe for
finding results from the raw data -- will be recorded in analysis
files (.anf) and become instantly reproducible. Even if you need to
replace some of the underlying data in your experiments, you do not
need to re-develop the recipe (filters, operations, graphs) to
squeeze the results you want out of the system.</p>
