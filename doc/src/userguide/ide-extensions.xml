  <title>Extending the IDE</title>
  <para>There are several ways to extend the functionality of the &Omnetpp; IDE. The
    Simulation IDE is based on the Eclipse platform, and extends it with new 
    editors, views, wizards, and other functionality.

    <title>Installing new features</title>
    <para>
    Because the IDE is based on the Eclipse platform, it is possible to add additional features
    that are available for Eclipse. The installation procedure is exactly the same as with
    a standard Eclipse distribution. Choose the ``Help | Install New Software...'' menu item
    and select an existing Update Site to work with or add a new Site (using the site URL) 
    to the Available Software Sites.
    After the selection you can browse and install the packages the site offers. 
    </para>
    <para>To read about installing new software into your IDE, please visit the ``Updating and
    installing software'' topic in the ``Workbench User Guide''. You can find the online help system
    in the ``Help | Help Contents'' menu.
    </para>
    <tip>
    There are thousands of useful components and extensions for Eclipse. 
    The best places to start looking for extensions are the Eclipse Marketplace 
    (http://marketplace.eclipse.org/) and the Eclipse Plugins info site 
    (http://www.eclipse-plugins.info).

    <title>Adding new Wizards</title>
    <para>
    In addition to the possibility to add new, independent software features to the &Omnetpp; IDE,
    it has its own extension mechanisms. One of the easiest ways to extend the IDE is by adding
    new Wizards to it. Wizards can be used to create new projects, simulations or files using simple
    templates. They can be created without writing any code in Java and can be installed by simply 
    copying the wizard's code into the ``templates'' folder of an &Omnetpp; project. 
    Wizards are activated automatically once their project is opened. This is a difference compared
    to the normal Elcipse extensions which are always active.   
     
    </para>
    <tip>You can read more about Wizards in the ``IDE Customization Guide'' document</tip>

    <title>Project specific extensions</title>
    <para>
       While it is possible to install an Eclipse plugin directly into the &Omnetpp; IDE, sometimes we need
       extensions that are used only by a single simulation project (e.g. special project related
       views or editors). These extensions are useful only if we are working with that project and
       are meaningless for other projects.
    </para>
    <para>
       It is possible to install an Eclipse plugin into a single project by simply creating a ``plugins'' folder
       in the root of the project and copying the plugin JAR file there. This extension mechanism 
       allows the distribution of model specific IDE extensions inside a simulation project.
       Plugins and wizards - distributed with a project - are automatically activated when the host 
       project is opened. 
    </para>
    <para>
       Eclipse plugin JAR files can be created using the ``Plugin Development Environment''. 
       The &Omnetpp; IDE does not contain the ``PDE'' by default, however it can be easily installed if need.
    </para>
    <tip>Read the ``&Omnetpp; IDE Development Guide'' for more information about how to install the PDE and
    how to develop plugin extensions for the IDE</tip>
