\label{sec:config-options:config-options}

%% To bring this chapter up to date, run opp_run -h latexconfig, and paste
%% the result. When committing, make sure no option gets lost (e.g parsim
%% or MPI-related options; opp_run can only print options from code that
%% enabled at compile time!)

This section lists all configuration options that are available in ini files.
A similar list can be obtained from any simulation executable by running it
with the \ttt{-h configdetails} option.

\begin{description}
\item[**.bin-recording] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    Per-object setting for scalar results.\\
    Whether the bins of the matching histogram object should be recorded,
    provided that recording of the histogram object itself is enabled
    (**.<scalar-name>.scalar-recording=true).  Usage:
    <module-full-path>.<scalar-name>.bin-recording=true/false. To control
    histogram recording from a @statistic, use <statistic-name>:histogram for
    <scalar-name>. Example: **.ping.roundTripTime:histogram.bin-recording=false
\item[check-signals] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Controls whether the simulation kernel will validate signals emitted by
    modules and channels against signal declarations (@signal properties) in
    NED files. The default setting depends on the build type: 'true' in DEBUG,
    and 'false' in RELEASE mode.
\item[cmdenv-autoflush] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Call fflush(stdout) after each event banner or status update; affects both
    express and normal mode. Turning on autoflush may have a performance
    penalty, but it can be useful with printf-style debugging for tracking down
    program crashes.
\item[cmdenv-config-name] = \textit{<string>}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Specifies the name of the configuration to be run (for a value `Foo',
    section [Config Foo] will be used from the ini file). See also
    cmdenv-runs-to-execute=. The -c command line option overrides this setting.
\item[cmdenv-event-banner-details] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    When cmdenv-express-mode=false: print extra information after event
    banners.
\item[cmdenv-event-banners] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    When cmdenv-express-mode=false: turns printing event banners on/off.
\item[cmdenv-express-mode] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Selects ``normal'' (debug/trace) or ``express'' mode.
\item[cmdenv-extra-stack] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{B}, default: \ttt{8KiB}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Specifies the extra amount of stack that is reserved for each activity()
    simple module when the simulation is run under Cmdenv.
\item[cmdenv-interactive] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Defines what Cmdenv should do when the model contains unassigned
    parameters. In interactive mode, it asks the user. In non-interactive mode
    (which is more suitable for batch execution), Cmdenv stops with an error.
\item[cmdenv-log-prefix] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{[\%l]	}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Specifies the format string that determines the prefix of each log line.
    The format string may contain format directives in the syntax '\%x' (a '\%'
    followed by a single format character).  For example '\%l' stands for log
    level, and '\%J' for source component. See the manual for the list of
    available format characters.
\item[**.cmdenv-log-level] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{TRACE}\\
    Per-object setting for modules.\\
    Specifies the per-component level of detail recorded by log statements,
    output below the specified level is omitted. Available values are (case
    insensitive): off, fatal, error, warn, info, detail, debug or trace. Note
    that the level of detail is also controlled by the globally specified
    runtime log level and the COMPILETIME\_LOGLEVEL macro that is used to
    completely remove log statements from the executable.
\item[cmdenv-output-file] = \textit{<filename>}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    When a filename is specified, Cmdenv redirects standard output into the
    given file. This is especially useful with parallel simulation. See the
    `fname-append-host' option as well.
\item[cmdenv-performance-display] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    When cmdenv-express-mode=true: print detailed performance information.
    Turning it on results in a 3-line entry printed on each update, containing
    ev/sec, simsec/sec, ev/simsec, number of messages created/still
    present/currently scheduled in FES.
\item[cmdenv-runs-to-execute] = \textit{<string>}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Specifies which runs to execute from the selected configuration (see
    cmdenv-config-name=). It accepts a comma-separated list of run numbers or
    run number ranges, e.g. 1,3..4,7..9. If the value is missing, Cmdenv
    executes all runs in the selected configuration. The -r command line option
    overrides this setting.
\item[cmdenv-status-frequency] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{s}, default: \ttt{2s}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    When cmdenv-express-mode=true: print status update every n seconds.
\item[configuration-class] = \textit{<string>}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Part of the Envir plugin mechanism: selects the class from which all
    configuration information will be obtained. This option lets you replace
    omnetpp.ini with some other implementation, e.g. database input. The
    simulation program still has to bootstrap from an omnetpp.ini (which
    contains the configuration-class setting). The class should implement the
    cConfigurationEx interface.
\item[constraint] = \textit{<string>}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    For scenarios. Contains an expression that iteration variables (\$\{\}
    syntax) must satisfy for that simulation to run. Example: \$i < \$j+1.
\item[cpu-time-limit] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{s}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Stops the simulation when CPU usage has reached the given limit. The
    default is no limit.
\item[debug-on-errors] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    When set to true, runtime errors will cause the simulation program to break
    into the C++ debugger (if the simulation is running under one, or
    just-in-time debugging is activated). Once in the debugger, you can view
    the stack trace or examine variables.
\item[debug-statistics-recording] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Turns on the printing of debugging information related to statistics
    recording (@statistic properties)
\item[debugger-attach-command] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{nemiver --attach=\%u \&}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Command line to launch the debugger. It must contain exactly one percent
    sign, as '\%u', which will be replaced by the PID of this process. The
    command must not block (i.e. it should end in '\&' on Unix-like systems).
\item[debugger-attach-on-error] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    When set to true, runtime errors and crashes will trigger an external
    debugger to be launched, allowing you to perform just-in-time debugging on
    the simulation process. The debugger command is configurable. Note that
    debugging (i.e. attaching to) a non-child process needs to be explicitly
    enabled on some systems, e.g. Ubuntu.
\item[debugger-attach-on-startup] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    When set to true, the simulation program will launch an external debugger
    attached to it, allowing you to set breakpoints before proceeding. The
    debugger command is configurable.  Note that debugging (i.e. attaching to)
    a non-child process needs to be explicitly enabled on some systems, e.g.
    Ubuntu.
\item[debugger-attach-wait-time] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{s}, default: \ttt{20s}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    An interval to wait after launching the external debugger, to give the
    debugger time to start up and attach to the simulation process.
\item[description] = \textit{<string>}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Descriptive name for the given simulation configuration. Descriptions get
    displayed in the run selection dialog.
\item[eventlog-file] = \textit{<filename>}, default: \ttt{\$\{resultdir\}/\$\{configname\}-\$\{runnumber\}.elog}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Name of the eventlog file to generate.
\item[eventlog-message-detail-pattern] = \textit{<custom>}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    A list of patterns separated by '|' character which will be used to write
    message detail information into the eventlog for each message sent during
    the simulation. The message detail will be presented in the sequence chart
    tool. Each pattern starts with an object pattern optionally followed by ':'
    character and a comma separated list of field patterns. In both patterns
    and/or/not/* and various field match expressions can be used. The object
    pattern matches to class name, the field pattern matches to field name by
    default.
      EVENTLOG-MESSAGE-DETAIL-PATTERN := ( DETAIL-PATTERN '|' )*
    DETAIL\_PATTERN
      DETAIL-PATTERN := OBJECT-PATTERN [ ':' FIELD-PATTERNS ]
      OBJECT-PATTERN := MATCH-EXPRESSION
      FIELD-PATTERNS := ( FIELD-PATTERN ',' )* FIELD\_PATTERN

    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    The expected fingerprints of the simulation. If you need multiple
    fingerprints, separate them with commas. When provided, the fingerprints
    will be calculated from the specified properties of simulation events,
    messages, and statistics during execution, and checked against the provided
    values. Fingerprints are suitable for crude regression tests. As
    fingerprints occasionally differ across platforms, more than one value can
    be specified for a single fingerprint, separated by spaces, and a match
    with any of them will be accepted. To obtain a fingerprint, enter a dummy
    value (such as "0000"), and run the simulation.
\item[fingerprintcalculator-class] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{omnetpp::cSingleFingerprintCalculator}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Part of the Envir plugin mechanism: selects the fingerprint calculator class to be
    used to calculate the simulation fingerprint. The class has to implement
    the cFingerprintCalculator interface.

    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Configures the fingerprint calculator to consider only certain events. The
    value is a pattern that will be matched against the event name by default.
    It may also be an expression containing pattern matching characters, field
    access, and logical operators. The default setting is '*' which includes
    all events in the calculated fingerprint. If you configured multiple
    fingerprints, separate filters with commas.
\item[fingerprint-ingredients] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{tplx}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Specifies the list of ingredients to be taken into account for fingerprint
    computation. Each character corresponds to one ingredient: 'e' event
    number, 't' simulation time, 'n' message (event) full name, 'c' message
    (event) class name, 'k' message kind, 'l' message bit length, 'o' message

    name, 'p' module full path, 'a' module class name, 'r' random numbers
    drawn, 's' scalar results, 'z' statistic results, 'v' vector results, 'x'
    extra data provided by modules. Note: ingredients specified in an expected
    fingerprint (characters after the '/' in the fingerprint value) take
    precedence over this setting. If you configured multiple fingerprints,
    separate ingredients with commas.
\item[fingerprint-modules] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{*}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Configures the fingerprint calculator to consider only certain modules. The
    value is a pattern that will be matched against the module full path by
    default. It may also be an expression containing pattern matching
    characters, field access, and logical operators. The default setting is '*'
    which includes all events in all modules in the calculated fingerprint. If
    you configured multiple fingerprints, separate filters with commas.
\item[fingerprint-results] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{*}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Configures the fingerprint calculator to consider only certain results. The
    value is a pattern that will be matched against the result full path by
    default. It may also be an expression containing pattern matching
    characters, field access, and logical operators. The default setting is '*'
    which includes all results in all modules in the calculated fingerprint. If
    you configured multiple fingerprints, separate filters with commas.
\item[fname-append-host] = \textit{<bool>}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Turning it on will cause the host name and process Id to be appended to the
    names of output files (e.g. omnetpp.vec, omnetpp.sca). This is especially
    useful with distributed simulation. The default value is true if parallel
    simulation is enabled, false otherwise.
\item[futureeventset-class] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{omnetpp::cEventHeap}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\

    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    A semicolon-separated list of directories. The directories will be regarded
    as roots of the NED package hierarchy, and all NED files will be loaded
    from their subdirectory trees. This option is normally left empty, as the
    OMNeT++ IDE sets the NED path automatically, and for simulations started
    outside the IDE it is more convenient to specify it via a command-line
    option or the NEDPATH environment variable.
\item[network] = \textit{<string>}\\

\item[output-scalar-precision] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{14}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    The number of significant digits for recording data into the output scalar

    The number of significant digits for recording data into the output vector
    file. The maximum value is ~15 (IEEE double precision). This setting has no
    effect on the "time" column of output vectors, which are represented as
    fixed-point numbers and always get recorded precisely.
\item[output-vectors-memory-limit] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{B}, default: \ttt{16MiB}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Total memory that can be used for buffering output vectors. Larger values
    produce less fragmented vector files (i.e. cause vector data to be grouped

    time to real time. For example, scaling=2 will cause simulation time to
    progress twice as fast as runtime.

    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Enables recording an eventlog file, which can be later visualized on a
    sequence chart. See eventlog-file= option too.
\item[repeat] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{1}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\

\item[replication-label] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{\#\$\{repetition\}}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Identifies one replication of a measurement (see repeat= and

\item[**.result-recording-modes] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{default}\\
    Per-object setting for statistics (@statistic).\\
    Defines how to calculate results from the matching @statistic. Usage:
    <module-full-path>.<statistic-name>.result-recording-modes=<modes>. Special
    values: default, all: they select the modes listed in the record= key of
    @statistic; all selects all of them, default selects the non-optional ones
    (i.e. excludes the ones that end in a question mark). Example values:
    vector, count, last, sum, mean, min, max, timeavg, stats, histogram. More
    than one values are accepted, separated by commas. Expressions are allowed.
    Items prefixed with '-' get removed from the list. Example:
    **.queueLength.result-recording-modes=default,-vector,+timeavg
\item[**.rng-\%] = \textit{<int>}\\
    Per-object setting for modules and channels.\\
    Maps a module-local RNG to one of the global RNGs. Example: **.gen.rng-1=3
    maps the local RNG 1 of modules matching `**.gen' to the global RNG 3. The
    value may be an expression, with the index and ancestorIndex() operators
    being potentially very useful. The default is one-to-one mapping, i.e. RNG
    k of all modules refer to the global RNG k (for k=0..num-rngs-1). Usage:
    <module-full-path>.rng-<local-index>=<global-index>. Examples:
    **.mac.rng-0=1; **.source[*].rng-0=index
\item[rng-class] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{omnetpp::cMersenneTwister}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    The random number generator class to be used. It can be `cMersenneTwister',
    `cLCG32', `cAkaroaRNG', or you can use your own RNG class (it must be
    subclassed from cRNG).
\item[runnumber-width] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{0}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Setting a nonzero value will cause the \$runnumber variable to get padded
    with leading zeroes to the given length.
\item[**.scalar-recording] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    Per-object setting for scalar results.\\
    Whether the matching output scalars and statistic objects should be
    recorded. Usage:
    <module-full-path>.<scalar-name>.scalar-recording=true/false. To
    enable/disable individual recording modes for a @statistic (those added via
    the record=... key of @statistic or the **.result-recording-modes=...
    config option), use <statistic-name>:<mode> for <scalar-name>, and make
    sure the @statistic as a whole is not disabled with
    **.<statistic-name>.statistic-recording=false. Example:
    **.ping.roundTripTime:stddev.scalar-recording=false
\item[scheduler-class] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{omnetpp::cSequentialScheduler}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Part of the Envir plugin mechanism: selects the scheduler class. This
    plugin interface allows for implementing real-time, hardware-in-the-loop,
    distributed and distributed parallel simulation. The class has to implement
    the cScheduler interface.
\item[sectionbasedconfig-configreader-class] = \textit{<string>}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    When configuration-class=SectionBasedConfiguration: selects the
    configuration reader C++ class, which must subclass from
    cConfigurationReader.
\item[seed-\%-lcg32] = \textit{<int>}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    When cLCG32 is selected as random number generator: seed for the kth RNG.
    (Substitute k for '\%' in the key.)
\item[seed-\%-mt] = \textit{<int>}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    When Mersenne Twister is selected as random number generator (default):
    seed for RNG number k. (Substitute k for '\%' in the key.)
\item[seed-\%-mt-p\%] = \textit{<int>}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    With parallel simulation: When Mersenne Twister is selected as random
    number generator (default): seed for RNG number k in partition number p.
    (Substitute k for the first '\%' in the key, and p for the second.)
\item[seed-set] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{\$\{runnumber\}}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Selects the kth set of automatic random number seeds for the simulation.
    Meaningful values include \$\{repetition\} which is the repeat loop counter
    (see repeat= key), and \$\{runnumber\}.
\item[sim-time-limit] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{s}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Stops the simulation when simulation time reaches the given limit. The
    default is no limit.
\item[simtime-precision] = \textit{<custom>}, default: \ttt{ps}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Sets the resolution for the 64-bit fixed-point simulation time
    representation. Accepted values are: second-or-smaller time units (s, ms,
    us, ns, ps, fs or as), power-of-ten multiples of such units (e.g. 100ms),
    and base-10 scale exponents in the -18..0 range. The maximum representable
    simulation time depends on the resolution. The default is picosecond
    resolution, which offers a range of ~110 days.
\item[simtime-scale] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{-12}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    DEPRECATED in favor of simtime-precision. Sets the scale exponent, and thus
    the resolution of time for the 64-bit fixed-point simulation time
    representation. Accepted values are -18..0; for example, -6 selects
    microsecond resolution. -12 means picosecond resolution, with a maximum
    simtime of ~110 days.
\item[snapshot-file] = \textit{<filename>}, default: \ttt{\$\{resultdir\}/\$\{configname\}-\$\{runnumber\}.sna}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Name of the snapshot file.
\item[snapshotmanager-class] = \textit{<string>}, default: \ttt{omnetpp::envir::cFileSnapshotManager}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Part of the Envir plugin mechanism: selects the class to handle streams to
    which snapshot() writes its output. The class has to implement the
    cISnapshotManager interface.
\item[**.statistic-recording] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    Per-object setting for statistics (@statistic).\\
    Whether the matching @statistic should be recorded. This option lets one
    completely disable all recording from a @statistic. Disabling a @statistic
    this way is more efficient than specifying **.scalar-recording=false and
    **.vector-recording=false together. Usage:
    <module-full-path>.<statistic-name>.statistic-recording=true/false.
    Example: **.ping.roundTripTime.statistic-recording=false
\item[tkenv-default-config] = \textit{<string>}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Specifies which config Tkenv should set up automatically on startup. The
    default is to ask the user.
\item[tkenv-default-run] = \textit{<int>}, default: \ttt{0}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Specifies which run (of the default config, see tkenv-default-config) Tkenv
    should set up automatically on startup. The default is to ask the user.
\item[tkenv-extra-stack] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{B}, default: \ttt{48KiB}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Specifies the extra amount of stack that is reserved for each activity()
    simple module when the simulation is run under Tkenv.
\item[tkenv-plugin-path] = \textit{<path>}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Specifies the search path for Tkenv plugins. Tkenv plugins are .tcl files
    that get evaluated on startup.
\item[total-stack] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{B}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Specifies the maximum memory for activity() simple module stacks. You need
    to increase this value if you get a ``Cannot allocate coroutine stack''
    error.
\item[**.typename] = \textit{<string>}\\
    Per-object setting for modules and channels.\\
    Specifies type for submodules and channels declared with 'like <>'.
\item[user-interface] = \textit{<string>}\\
    Global setting (applies to all simulation runs).\\
    Selects the user interface to be started. Possible values are Cmdenv, Tkenv
    and Qtenv. This option is normally left empty, as it is more convenient to
    specify the user interface via a command-line option or the IDE's Run and
    Debug dialogs. New user interfaces can be defined by subclassing
    cRunnableEnvir.
\item[**.vector-max-buffered-values] = \textit{<int>}\\
    Per-object setting for vector results.\\
    For output vectors: the maximum number of values to buffer per vector,
    before writing out a block into the output vector file. The default is no
    per-vector limit (i.e. only the total memory limit is in effect). Usage:
    <module-full-path>.<vector-name>.vector-max-buffered-values=<count>.
\item[**.vector-record-eventnumbers] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    Per-object setting for vector results.\\
    Whether to record event numbers for an output vector. (Values and
    timestamps are always recorded.) Event numbers are needed by the Sequence
    Chart Tool, for example. Usage:
    <module-full-path>.<vector-name>.vector-record-eventnumbers=true/false.
    Example: **.ping.roundTripTime:vector.vector-record-eventnumbers=false
\item[**.vector-recording] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    Per-object setting for vector results.\\
    Whether data written into an output vector should be recorded. Usage:
    <module-full-path>.<vector-name>.vector-recording=true/false. To control
    vector recording from a @statistic, use <statistic-name>:vector for
    <vector-name>. Example: **.ping.roundTripTime:vector.vector-recording=false
\item[**.vector-recording-intervals] = \textit{<custom>}\\
    Per-object setting for vector results.\\
    Allows one to restrict recording of an output vector to one or more
    simulation time intervals. Usage:
    <module-full-path>.<vector-name>.vector-recording-intervals=<intervals>.
    The syntax for <intervals> is: [<from>]..[<to>],... That is, both start and
    end of an interval are optional, and intervals are separated by comma.
    Example: **.roundTripTime:vector.vector-recording-intervals=..100,
    200..400, 900..
\item[warmup-period] = \textit{<double>}, unit=\ttt{s}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Length of the initial warm-up period. When set, results belonging to the
    first x seconds of the simulation will not be recorded into output vectors,
    and will not be counted into output scalars (see option
    **.result-recording-modes). This option is useful for steady-state
    simulations. The default is 0s (no warmup period). Note that models that
    compute and record scalar results manually (via recordScalar()) will not
    automatically obey this setting.
\item[warnings] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{true}\\
    Per-simulation-run setting.\\
    Enables warnings.
\item[**.with-akaroa] = \textit{<bool>}, default: \ttt{false}\\
    Per-object setting for vector results.\\
    Whether the output vector should be under Akaroa control.
