Figures in the manual
=====================

Figures are maintained in figures.ppt. Filenames of figures should be given
as a one-line "Notes" text.

To create gif and pdf files needed for html and pdf versions of the manual:
 - open figures.ppt
 - Save As: GIF. This will create Slide1.gif, Slide2.gif etc. in the figures/ subdir.
 - Run the ExportNotesText macro, and type "figures-rename.bat" as file name
 - exit ppt

Note: we could export WMF as well, but ImageMagick's WMF rasterizes sucks.
It omits very thin lines altogether.

Then:
 - run figures-rename.bat to get normal filenames.
 - run figures-convert.bat to convert gifs to pdf.

figures-convert.bat uses ImageMagick 6. 

Note: ImageMagick's -trim option sucks. The original image size is somehow
leftin the file as meta-info, and screws up gif-to-pdf translation.
Needs to convert gif to png first, then from png to pdf :(

Because we use ImageMagick, all pdf figures will be raster images (not vector),
but oh well... Couldn't find good tool for batch wmf-to-pdf conversion 
(it should also crop the pictures because wmf's are full-slide size!)
