Figures in the manual
=====================

Figures are maintained in figures.ppt. Filenames of figures should be given
as a one-line "Notes" text.

To create gif and pdf files needed for html and pdf versions of the manual:
 - open figures.ppt
 - Save As: Windows Metafile (wmf). This will create Slide1.wmf, Slide2.wmf
   etc. in the figures/ subdir.
 - Run the ExportNotesText macro, and type "figures-rename.bat" as file name
 - exit ppt

Then:
 - run figures-rename.bat to get normal filenames.
 - run figures-convert.bat to convert wmf files to gif and pdf.

figures-convert.bat uses ImageMagick 6. PDF is created via gif (rather than
directly from wmf) because this strangely results in smaller files and
better quality (whatever -densite and -scale options are passed to wmf 
conversion).

Because we use ImageMagick, all pdf figures will be raster images (not vector),
but oh well... Couldn't find good tool for batch wmf-to-pdf conversion 
(it should also crop the pictures because wmf's are full-slide size!)
