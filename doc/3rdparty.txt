                THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE


The OMNeT++/OMNEST distribution contains several open source components
which are covered by their own licenses. These components are listed below,
together with their web sites where you can find more information and the
source code.

We'd like to thank the open source community for developing and making
these packages available. OMNeT++/OMNEST would not have been possible
without them.

1. Simulations built with the OMNeT++/OMNEST runtime are using the following
   *optional* open source components (i.e. it is possible to build a simulation
   without them, but with reduced functionality.)
