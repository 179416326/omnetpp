Third party software
====================

The Win32 binary distribution of OMNeT++ contains software which are
independent of OMNeT++, and are distributed under their own licenses.

The same software packages are recommended if you want to build OMNeT++
on Windows from source, using MSVC or the MinGW compiler.


Tcl/Tk
------
OMNeT++ GUIs are based on Tcl/Tk, an open-source script language and GUI
toolkit, written by James Ousterhout and many others. Tcl/Tk currently
maintained at sourceforge.net; it is available from
http://tcltk.sourceforge.net, and it is distributed under a BSD-like license.

BLT
---
BLT is an extension to the Tk toolkit, adding new widgets and miscellaneous 
commands. It does not require any patching of the Tcl or Tk source files. 
OMNeT++ uses BLT mainly for its chart, graph and table (multi-column listbox)
widgets. BLT is available from http://blt.sourceforge.net, and it is 
distributed under a BSD-like license.

LibXML/LibXSLT
--------------
LibXML and LibXSLT are an open-source XML parser and XSLT processor, written
by Daniel Veillard for the GNOME project. The source is available from
http://www.xmlsoft.org. OMNeT++ is bundled with Win32 binaries maintained
by Igor Zlatkovic, and currently available from 
http://www.zlatkovic.com/libxml.en.html
LibXML, LibXSLT and LibICONV (also a needed component) are distributed
under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

Perl
----
Some of the tools are written in Perl, an open-source script language written
by Larry Wall. The source is available from http://www.perl.com.
OMNeT++ is bundled with files from the ActiveState Perl distribution
(http://www.activestate.com). Perl is distributed under its own Artistic License.

UnxUtils
--------
Several GNU Unix tools have been included: grep, gawk, pwd, sed, gzip, gunzip,
zcat. These programs fall under the GNU General Public License, and the 
source is available from http://www.gnu.org. OMNeT++ is bundled with binaries
from UnxUtils, a package which contains Win32 binary ports of these tools.
UnxUtils is hosted at sourceforge.net: http://unxutils.sourceforge.net.
