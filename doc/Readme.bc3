OMNeT++ Installation on DOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the 1.2 release, OMNeT++ no longer supports DOS and Borland C++ 3.1.
It made no sense to continue the support, because the conventional 640K was
simply not enough for even small simulations.

However, if you're truly desperate to try, you still should be able to compile
the sources with BC31, for example with project files from the 1.1 (Feb99)
release.
