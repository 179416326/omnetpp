OMNeT++ Installation on DOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OMNeT++ does not support DOS and Borland C++ 3.1 since the 1.2 release.
The 640K memory available is simply not enough for even small simulations.
However, if you're truly desperate, you still should be able to compile
the sources, for example with project files from the 1.1 (Feb99) release.
