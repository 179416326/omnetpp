Activating pretty printing in GDB for standard C++ containers:

Windows:
  The bundled GDB and Python binaries are already configured to support gdb pretty printing.

Mac OS X:
  Mac OS comes with gdb 6.2 which does not support python pretty printing.

Linux:
  This directory must be included in the python system path and pretty printer classes must 
  be registered before starting gdb. This can be done by creating a '.gdbinit' 
  file in the $HOME directory with the following content. Do not forget to edit
  the path to point to this directory.

python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '/path/to/omnetpp/misc/gdb')
from libstdcxx.v6.printers import register_libstdcxx_printers
register_libstdcxx_printers (None)
print 'Python pretty printers initialized.'
end
