 - takeover from Queues-0.1:
     - checked in sources, tutorial.tex and *.el files
     - cosmetics on sources (tabs to spaces, indentation, file headings, etc.)
 - renamed 'some' script to 'run' (also in tutorial.tex)
 - removed the 'rm queues' line from the 'run' script, and removed the
   corresponding sentence from tutorial.tex too.
 - TODO: write makefile for compiling tutorial.tex into pdf
 - added MSVC makefiles
