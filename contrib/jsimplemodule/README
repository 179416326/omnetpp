JSimpleModule
=============

This is an extension that makes it possible to write OMNeT++ simple modules
in Java. Details are in jsimple/README -- read it before you start programming!

You'll need to install JDT (=Java development support) into the OMNeT++ IDE. 
The process is described at XXXX.

The jsimple and jsamples directories are Eclipse projects that can be imported
into the IDE.

Enjoy,
Andras
