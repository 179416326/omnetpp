JSimpleModule
=============

This is an extension that makes it possible to write OMNeT++ simple modules
in Java. Java and C++-based simple modules can be freely mixed in
simulations. Integration is not seamless though, there are limitations as
to what OMNeT++ features are available, as well special coding rules to
obey in the Java code.

Overview:

    submodules:
        fifo: JSimpleModule;
            parameters:
                javaClass = "Fifo";
