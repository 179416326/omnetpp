JSimpleModule
=============

This is an extension that makes it possible to write OMNeT++ simple modules
in Java. Java and C++-based simple modules can be freely mixed in
simulations. Integration is not seamless though, there are limitations as
to what OMNeT++ features are available, as well special coding rules to
obey in the Java code.

Operation is based on the JSimpleModule class. This is an ordinary C++
simple module, which receives the name of a Java class in a module parameter.
During initialize, it loads the Java Virtual Machine (if not already loaded),
instantiates the given Java class, then simply delegates initialize(),
handleMessage() and finish() calls to it. The Java class should be subclassed
from org.omnetpp.simkernel.JSimpleModule, which provides the usual methods:
send(), scheduleAt(), cancelEvent(), etc. Messages are instances of
org.omnetpp.simkernel.cMessage, and the org.omnetpp.simkernel package contains
Java versions of most simulation kernel classes.

The org.omnetpp.simkernel.* Java classes are just JNI-based wrappers around
the corresponding C++ classes: every Java object holds a pointer to a
corresponding C++ object, and delegates all method calls to it. This
has a few consequences about the programming model, as will be covered later.
The wrapper classes have been generated using SWIG (www.swig.org).


Usage:
    submodules:
        fifo: JSimpleModule;
            parameters:
                javaClass = "Fifo";
