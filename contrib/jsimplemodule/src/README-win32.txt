README for JSimpleModule-Win32
------------------------------

SimpleModule is an extension that makes it possible to write OMNeT++ simple
modules in Java. This package contains a simulation executable with the
JSimpleModule C++ sources compiled in, and also an Eclipse project set up
for Java development.

You don't need a C++ compiler at all to create models in Java with this
package. Support libraries, icons, etc are NOT included with the package;
the easiest way to obtain them is to install the OMNeT++ Windows binary
release.

This package is also an Eclipse project. If you import it into the Eclipse
workspace, your can start programming right away. You can run the
simulation from Eclipse by double-clicking the run.bat file.

Please read the (other) README for more info on how to use this package.
