Re: swig wrapped files + doxygen

Hi William, 

A while ago you wrote:

I would give it a try, if I get some help. I wish SWIG had an option to add comments into the Java files with C++ file/line info:

  // @from cmodule.h:342
  public void scheduleStart(double t) {
    SimkernelJNI.cModule_scheduleStart(swigCPtr, t);
  }

Then it would be trivial to write a Perl script (or whatever other tool) to grab the comments from the C++ headers, and paste them over into the Java files. The rest is cosmetics.

Would it be possible to extend SWIG with such an option? I guess when SWIG generates code, it knows where in the C++ files those classes and methods came from, because it itself parsed it?
