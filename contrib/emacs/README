NED Syntax Highlight in GNU Emacs
=================================

    Author's comment:
    "I have attached a lisp file that implements syntax highlighting
    when editing OMNeT++ .ned file with GNU Emacs. It's not that sophisticated
    but it works OK. Maybe, someone finds this useful (my students like it :-)"

The file ned-mode.el is a simple hack to allow syntax highlighting when
editing OMNeT++ .ned files with Emacs. It has been tested with Emacs 20.3.
 
To make Emacs recognize .ned files put this in your .emacs:

(autoload 'ned-mode "ned-mode" "Major Mode for editing Ned files" t)
(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.ned\\'" . ned-mode) auto-mode-alist))

If you put your ned-mode.el somewhere emacs doesn't find it, add this
to your .emacs before the two statements above:

(setq load-path (cons "path_to_directory" load-path))
