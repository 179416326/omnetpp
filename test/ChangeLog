	* opp_test.pl: To make it easier to create new test cases from
        existing ones, removed %name from test file syntax; now test name
        is derived from the file name. Cleaned up error handling.
        Changed some command-line switches. Introduced {} as synonim for 
        @TESTNAME@. Improved reporting.

        * runtest: accepts command-line args
