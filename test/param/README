Parameter resolution test

The test contains a perl script which generates a Network and
a corresponding omnetpp.ini with a number of parameter declarations
and assignments. Each parameter covers a particular use case.

To prepare for testing build the executable with make,
run 'param < param.in > param.out' and remove the surrounding
irrelevant output from the resulting file.

The output file now contains the parameter values as seen by
the runtime. Now the task is to compare these values to those
presented in the OMNeT++ IDE for the very same omnetpp.ini and
Network.
