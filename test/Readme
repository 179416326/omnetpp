OMNeT++ Regression Test Tool
============================

Each test case is a single *.test file. All NED, C++ and other
files are embedded into the test case files as well as PASS
criteria. The advantages for this design are twofold:
 - test cases are self-contained (easy to share, etc)
 - enforces test cases that are compact and to the point

Usage in nutshell:
 1. create *.test files
 2. run opp_test with -g option to generate the source files from *.test
 3. create a makefile (opp_makemake) and build the test program
 4. run opp_test with -r option to execute the tests
All files will be created in the working directory.

A test file may contain the following entries:

Generic entries:
   %name: <test-case-name>

   %description:
   <test-description-lines>

Test case components:
   %source:
   <C++-source-lines>

   %file: <file-name>
   <file-contents>

   %inifile: [<inifile-name>]
   <inifile-contents>

Conditions for PASS:
   %exitcode: <numeric-exit-code>

   %ignore-exitcode

   %contains: <output-file-to-check>
   <regexp-pattern>

   %not-contains: <output-file-to-check>
   <regexp-pattern>
