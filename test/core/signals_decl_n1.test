Negative test: trying to produce all 9 error messages currently in the code:

- Undeclared signal "%s" emitted (@signal missing from NED file?)
- Wrong type "%s" in the @signal[%s] property in the "%s" NED type, should be one of: long, unsigned long, double, simtime_t, string, or a registered class name
- Signal "%s" emitted with wrong class (%s does not subclass from %s as declared)
- Signal "%s" emitted as timestamped value with wrong type (%s, but object expected)
- Signal "%s" emitted as timestamped value with NULL pointer in it (should be a %s as declared)
- Signal "%s" emitted as timestamped value with wrong class in it (%s does not subclass from %s as declared)
- Signal "%s" emitted with wrong data type (expected=%s, actual=%s)
- Signal "%s" emitted as a timestamped value with wrong data type (expected=%s, actual=%s)
- Signal "%s" emitted with wrong data type (expected=%s, actual=%s) [same a 2nd above, but issued on different condition]
