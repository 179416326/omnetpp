- expressions in channel defs
- check: all comments must end in a newline!! (or be empty)
- nedgen: indent should be skipped if we're not at end of line (ie prev comment="")
- use vsnprintf() instead of vsprintf everywhere (also in sim/!)
- update ned.dtd to NED-2! properties, chan-attrs instead of parameters, 
- disp string should become a property, etc.
- comments as child elements (w/ content as body) rather than attributes
