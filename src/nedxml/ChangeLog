	* cppgenerator.cc: updated for fullPath() signature change (see 
	include/ChangeLog)

2004-10-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0a8 released ------

2004-09-24  ------ omnetpp-3.0a7 released ------

        * saxparser_libxml.cc: if document has DOCTYPE, validate document 
        and complete attrs from DTD.

        * saxparser_expat.cc: error message if document has DOCTYPE declared,
        because we cannot validate it with Expat, nor complete default attrs
        from DTD

2004-07-27  Andras Varga

        * ned.lex: fixed "`yytext_ptr' undeclared" error with some flex 
        versions

2004-07-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a6 released ------

2004-07-20  Andras Varga

        * ned.dtd, ned.y: added source-code attribute to ned-file element,
        and code to fill it when parsing NED source

2004-06-24  Andras Varga

        * several files: added support for "xml" NED parameter type

2004-06-07  ------ omnetpp-3.0a5 released ------

2004-06-07  Andras Varga

        * cppgenerator.cc: wrong C++ code was generated for "const" parameters
        [reported by Julien Cartigny]

2004-05-15  ------ omnetpp-3.0a4 released ------

2004-05-13  Andras Varga

        * ned.lex: recognize hex numbers as INTCONSTANT

2004-03-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a3 released ------

FIXME: input() with expression as default value is handled wrong

2004-03-06  Andras Varga

        * added support for enum declarations <enum-decl>

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-02-20  Andras Varga

        * cppgenerator.cc: implemented cChannel && cChannelType; several
        refinements in generated code

        * ned.dtd, ebnf.y: added support for "mod.out++ --> in++" connection
        syntax, where "++" causes the first, yet unconnected gate to be used,
        and (with submodule gate vectors) it also expands the vector if 
        necessary, so "gatesizes:" is not needed. Gate vectors of the parent
        module cannot be expanded further (because network is built and
        connected top-down.)

        * cppgenerator.cc, cppexprgenerator.cc: several bugfixes in the 
        generated code

2004-02-11  Andras Varga

        * ned.y: didn't accept negative numbers and symbolic constants in
        msg files as field and enum values

2004-02-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0pre1 released ------

2003-10-19  Andras Varga

        * nedelement.cc/h: added userdata field which makes it possible
        to attach additional data to NEDElement objects (needed for GNED)

2003-08-30  Andras Varga

        * ned.dtd: storing of "like" parameters changed (attribute @like-param
        introduced)

        * ned.dtd: const/@value made optional (because we cannot distinguish 
        empty attribute ("") and missing attribute, and "" string constant 
        caused validation error).

2003-07-31  Andras Varga

        * updated for current syntax of message declarations (dtd change)

2003-07-27  Andras Varga

        * ned.dtd: added source-code attribute to top-level elements; this 
        is useful for documentation generation.

2003-06-16  ------ omnetpp-2.3 released ------

2003-03-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b2 released ------

2003-02-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b1 released ------

2002-11-30  Andras Varga

        * development of NEDXML is under way. Until the code reaches a stable
        state, I use a local CVS repository on my home PC for convenience, 
        and periodically update the main OMNeT++ CVS from the local CVS.

        * ned.y (swapAttributes): compile fix for gcc 3.x: Ambiguous
        implicit conversion for NEDString::NEDString(NEDString)
        
2002-06-08  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * Makefile.in: created from Makefile.vc

        * initial revision
