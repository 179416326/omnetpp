rem  Substitute the correct file names/paths in the command line below!
rem 
rem  wish: the Tcl/Tk interpreter. You may find it under different names,
rem    for example "wish80.exe" in the standard Tk distribution or
rem    "cygwish80.exe" in CYGWIN-B20. Files like "wishx.exe", "tixwish.exe",
rem    "wishx80.exe" etc. will also do, they are just "wishes" with different
rem    extensions compiled in.
rem  
rem  You should also manually correct the location of the "plove" file below
rem  according to your OMNeT++ installation directory.
rem

wish -f d:\omnetpp\src\plove\plove
