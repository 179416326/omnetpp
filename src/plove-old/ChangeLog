 - now you can build a single Plove executable, with all Tcl code compiled in.
   This made it necessary to reorganize the makefiles too.
Apr 3, 2001
 - fix: the app window didn't acquire focus on startup (added deiconify command)
Apr 16, 2001
 - Plove can now be compiled as GUI application (not console app) on Windows,
   setting USE_WINMAIN=yes in configuser.vc.
   NOTE: main() and WinMain() use completely different startup sequences.
   The reason: main()'s startup code with WinMain would result in an "unknown
   channel stdout" error in the Tcl code (and it's not so easy to create a
   dummy channel named stdout), while WinMain()'s startup sequence with main()
   would result in a working command prompt in the console window (!!!).
   Pretty weird.
