  - adopted to sim105 & 'multiple runs' bug fixed
  - ini file warning changed from ev.printfmsg() to ev.printf()
#80  Mar 6, 1997
  - new cInifile members: getAs..2()
  - better ini file warnings
  - gen1_seed=, gen2_seed= etc entries added; not complete
#81  Mar 6, 1997

  - small modifications
#84  Mar 15, 1997
  - pvm stuff (cSlaveApp) modified
#85  Mar 16, 1997
  - Style of ini file [Machines] section changed from:
      whale.hit.bme.hu = node1, node2
      dolphin.hit.bme.hu = node3
    to:
      node1 = whale.hit.bme.hu
      node2 = whale.hit.bme.hu
      node3 = dolphin.hit.bme.hu
#86  Mar 21, 1997
  - changes on PVM stuff. *** COMPATIBLE WITH SIM122 OR UP ***
     '-s' flag replaced with call to is_started_as_master()
     more error checks
  - copyright msg modified
#87  Mar 24, 1997
  - file logging added to TSlaveApp ("slaveapp.log")

  Improvements on distributed execution:
  - ini file options added to enable logging of messages produced by slaves:
       [Slaves]
       write-slavelog = true/false
       slavelog-file = slave.log
    Output between TSlaveApp creation and ini file processing is written in
    the file "slave.log".
  - changed TOmnetApp::foreignputs()
#97 Jul 31, 1997
  - a bug introduced in #96 fixed
  - [General]/number-of-runs= ini file setting was removed; its place is
    taken by [Cmdenv]/runs-to-execute=
  - added: cInifileSectionIterator
  - compatible with: cmdenv87 and up
#98 Aug 4, 1997
  - fixed a bug with reporting how many rnd gens were initialized from table
  - [Slaves]/module-messages= flag added; works similarly to Cmdenv's.
    Default value is NO: module messages from slaves do not appear on console.
#99 Aug 7, 1997
  - omnetapp.cc: cNetSimpleMod corrected to cNetMod
  - compatibility: sim144a or later
#100 Aug 8, 1997
  - other [Slaves] options added that control whether different kinds of
    textual messages should be routed to the console:
       errmsgs-to-console=
       infomsgs-to-console=
       modmsgs-to-console=
  - updated for sim144c
#101 Aug 17, 1997
  - TOTAL_STACK increased to 2Mb
  - extrastack() support added
  - new ini file entry: [General]/netif-check-freq=  (default:1)
  - compatibility: sim146a
#102 Aug 17, 1997
  - small bug in ini file reader fixed
  - readPerRunOptions(1) in TOmnetApp::setup() commented out
#103 Oct 2, 1997
  - cleaned up & renamed several member functions; compatible with sim147
#104 Oct 6, 1997
  - further renaming; compatible with sim148
#105 Oct 10, 1997
  - added endl to cenvir.h. Example: ev << "Hello!" << endl;
#106 Dec 13, 1997
  - for clarity, section name [All runs] changed to [Parameters]
#107 Feb 15, 1998
  - makefile made compatible with configure script; envir.a-->libenvir.a
#108 March 26, 1998
  - use of gets() eliminated
#109 April 27, 1998
  - new ini file option: [General] / total-stack-kb=
    Holds the total stack size (in KB) needed by module coroutines.
  - makefile can now create shared object (libenvir.so)
  - support for dynamic loading of libraries: -l command line option.
    `foo -l ./token.so' (if `foo' is an OMNeT++ executable) will now
    load the token.so file at startup.
#110 May 11, 1998
  - multiple -f and -l options: several ini files and libraries can be loaded
    (If you want to do several simulation runs with their parameters
     in separate files, multiple -f will be very useful!)
  - ini files can include each other. Syntax:
      ...
      include second.ini
      ...
  - wildcard parameters in ini files. Like:
      [Parameters]
      net.station[*].gen_rate=100
    Wildcard characters are: * ?, and {} for range (using the conventional
    [] would be very inconvenient because they would interfere with vector
    indices).
#111 May 12, 1998
  - bugfixes
#112 May 20, 1998
  - `ev << ..' conversions for doubles changed
#113 June 9, 1998
  - new ini file option: output-scalar-file= (in [General] or [Run-nn] section)
    (supported from sim162 up)
#114 June 18, 1998
  - opt_inifile_name bug fixed
#115 June 19,1998
  - call to simulation.setup() added to TOmnetApp.setup()
#116 June 24,1998
  - modifications to cinifile.cc
  - return value of TOmnetApp::askYesNo changed from bool to int (-1==cancel)
  - other small fixes
#117 July 10, 1998
  - main stack size increased to 64K
  - new ini file option: [General]/load-libs=
#118 July 15, 1998
  - small fixes
#119 July 20, 1998
  Improved cIniFile: wildcards understood in keys; keys may contain whitespace
  Support for output vector configuration from ini file
  - getOutVectorConfig() added to cEnvir and TOmnetApp classes
  - output vector config is taken from [OutVectors] or [Run nn] section.
    Syntax:
      module.vectorname.enabled=yes/no
      module.vectorname.interval=10s..30s
    Output vectors are enabled by default.
#120 July 24, 1998
  - getDisplayString() added to cEnvir and TOmnetApp classes
  - display strings now can be taken from [DisplayStrings] or [Run nn]
    section of the ini file (hardcoded display strings take precendence
    over the ones in the ini file)
  - cIniFile edited -- getRaw() added
#121 August 12, 1998
  - Borland C++ 5.0 project file added
  - cenvir.h move to sim/
  - small fixes
#122 August 14, 1998
  - makefile fix
#123 August 17, 1998

  - makefile renamed to makefile.in
  - runningModule() corrected to contextModule in slaveapp.cc
#125 Jan 25, 1999
  - updated for sim172d
#126 Feb 9, 1999
  - updated for sim174
#127 June 21, 1999
  - all sources checked in under CVS
  - makefile.in modified for use with GNU Autoconf; also renamed to Makefile.in
  - version.log renamed to ChangeLog
  - removed support for DOS with BC3.1
Aug 13, 1999
  - cIniFile::readFile()'s include file handling modified. Now the included
    file doesn't need to start with a section header line: entries will use
    the current section header in the including file.
    BUT: section headers in the included file are not propagated back to the
    including file because it could lead to nasty behaviour.
Aug 30, 1999
  - Fixed a bug in omnetapp.cc which caused bogus reporting in the number
    of random number generators initialized from table and from ini file
------ omnetpp-2.0b released ------
Sept 20, 1999
 - typo fixed in Makefile.in: $(CLFAGS) --> $(CFLAGS)
------ omnetpp-2.0b2 released ------
Dec 4, 1999
  - first compile with MSVC. Minor changes: changed int to bool in some places
Dec 5, 1999
  - Makefile.vc added
Jan 9, 2000
  - bugfix: TOmnetApp's destructor made virtual
Jan 15, 2000
  - MSDOS #defines removed from the code (omnetapp.cc)
Jan 16, 2000
  - improvements in cinifile.cc
Jan 28, 2000
 -  main stack size increased to 128K (omnetapp.cc)
------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------
Mar 26, 2000
 - 'char *' pointers made const-correct (lots of 'char *' --> 'const char *'
   replacements throughout the code)
April 4, 2000
 - dynamic registration of user interface (TOmnetApp) classes introduced.
   (The formerly used method didn't make it possible to create separate DLLs
   on Windows: envir.dll, tkenv.dll, cmdenv.dll).
   See appreg.h, the Register_OmnetApp macros in cmdenv.cc and tkapp.cc,
   and the chooseBestOmnetApp() function in envir.cc.
April 6-10, 2000
 - changes to enable linking a Windows DLL from the library
 - the memoryIsLow() utility function was placed into this library, and now
   it works through a new TOmnetApp::memoryIsLow() function.
 - the "-u <user-interface>" command-line parameter is now understood by envir:
   this can be used to select the user interface if both Cmnenv and Tkenv is
   linked in (or is dynamically loaded).
   The [General]/user-interface= ini file option was also added, with the same
   functionality.
   This allows the user to link the simulation without Cmdenv and Tkenv, and
   load one of them at runtime, with a line like this in omnetpp.ini:
       [General]
       load-libs=../../lib/tkenv.so
       user-interface=Tkenv
   Or the command-line equivalent:
       mysim  -l ../../lib/tkenv.so  -u Tkenv
   To allow all the above, the setup procedure (cEnvir::setup()) and
   the constructor and the setup() function of TOmnetApp was reorganized.
Apr 10, 2000
 - TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false (C++ keywords)
 - in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by "%f","%g","%e"
May 7, 2000
 - Makefile.vc improvements from Balazs Kelemen
