	* Qtenv is ready for the OMNeT++ 5.0 beta 3 release.

	Most of Qtenv was implemented by Attila Torok and Mihaly Palenik
	between April and August 2015, using Tkenv code as scaffolding.
	It was then refined by them during fall 2015.

	OpenSceneGraph integration was mostly coded by Andras Varga.
	The build system is largely the work of Rudolf Hornig.

	* Qtenv: Added defunct Tkenv code as scaffolding for the code.
	(Tcl_VarEval() and other Tcl API functions have been replaced with
	dummy functions, so the original Tkenv code compiles but does
	nothing for the moment.)

	* Qtenv development started: Initial Qt code by Attila Torok.
