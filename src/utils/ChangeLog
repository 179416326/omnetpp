	* neddoc.xsl: module etc names in generated .dot files need quotes 
	otherwise they may clash with dot's reserved keywords ("Node")

2003-12-06  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake now will make some effort to find configuser.vc 
	by itself when no -c option is given

2003-12-05  Andras Varga

	* opp_neddoc and parts polished and brought to work on Windows.
	See tests at test/opp_neddoc.

	* opp_makemake.in, opp_nmakemake: a thorough rewrite of how 
	multi-directory models are handled. This version should be usable, 
	it's been proven on IPSuite and MPLS (I generated _all_ of its 
	Makefiles including the toplevel one with opp_(n)makemake). 
	The changes in nutshell:
	- opp_(n)makemake no longer invokes `make' in other directories
	  while generating the makefile. (It wasn't a very good idea in
	  the first place)
	- it is now possible to generate a Makefile that imports the 
	  settings from another file (via Makefile inclusion). Thus
	  you don't have to regenerate all the Makefiles (or edit the
	  settings in them) if you move to a different machine or change
	  the compile flags.
	- "recursive make" (descenting into subdirs) is now independent
	  from which directories you want to link with object files.
	  Recursive make is enabled with the -r option, and it'll simply
	  cause the Makefile to go into all subdirs and run make in them.
	  That's all. If you need to ensure a specific order or you want
	  to leave out certain subdirs, you can put additional dependencies
	  and rules into makefrag (makefrag.vc).
	- any file you list on the opp_(n)makemake command line is still 
	  something to link with. No change here. 
	- any directory on the opp_(n)makemake command line is a something
	  that (will) contain object files you want to link with. 
	  opp_(n)makemake won't specifically list the object files in the 
	  Makefile, it'll just say *.o (or *.obj). Also, it won't add 
	  dependencies to that directory -- you have to add that manually 
	  (see "recursive make" above).
	- one shortcut I found useful: the -w option causes linking with all
	  object files found in the -I (include) directories. That saves you
	  from listing directories with -I (because you want to import NED
	  files from there and #include header files) and again as argument
	  (because you also want to link with the object files from there) --
	  you just add -w, and the -I's.
	Note that primarily, linking with object files is considered and not
	building static or shared libraries. Putting modules into static
	libraries doesn't work very well on Unix (the linker tends to optimize
	too eagerly and leave out your modules from the executable), but 
	shared libraries are fine. On Windows, static libs have the same
	problem as on Unix; DLLs are more difficult to build.
	   Any customization should go to the makefrag(.vc) file. The above 
	machinery should probably be satisfactory for except very large and 
	very modular simulation models. If you find that you've outgrown
	the opp_makemake features, you should probably consider moving to
	CMake or Automake which are far more powerful.

2003-08-20  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake.in, opp_nmakemake: added missing dependency of _m.h 
	files on .msg files.

2003-07-28  Andras Varga

	* opp_neddoc/opp_neddocall: enhanced documentation generation, output 
	is now multi-frame html. Generated files go to the html/ subdirectory.

2003-06-16  ------ omnetpp-2.3 released ------

2003-05-24  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake: changed handling of -e option -- now, if no -e	option
	is given, opp_nmakemake tries to detect the C++ file extension 
	from files already in the directory.

2003-03-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b2 released ------

2003-03-15  Andras Varga

	* opp_nmakemake: fixed -l and -L options; clarified help text

2003-03-13  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: changed #include "omnetpp.h" to <omnetpp.h> in generated
	code

2003-03-11  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: couldn't run test program on Unix if "." was not 
	in the PATH

2003-02-15  ------ omnetpp-2.3b1 released ------

2003-02-08  Andras Varga 
	
	* opp_test: enhancement: %contains and %not-contains now do 
	substring match. Regexp match can be done with %contains-regex 
	and %not-contains-regex.

2003-01-30  Andras Varga 
	
	* opp_makemake.in: now runs make depend after makefile creation

2002-12-18  Andras Varga 

	* opp_stacktool.cmd added: it displays maximum reserved stack size
	for a program.

	* seedtool.cc: incorporated fix from N. Reijers. If too many seeds, 
	too far apart are requested, there were zeroes in the generated
	sequence. (See src for more info.)

2002-12-08  Andras Varga

	* opp_makemake, opp_nmakemake: handling of .ned files that use the 
	'experimental message subclassing' feature has changed. These files 
	should have .msg suffix, and they will be compiled by opp_msgc into 
	_m.h and _m.cc files. The '//--subclassing--' line is no longer needed.

2002-12-06  Andras Varga

        * added opp_neddocall: it documents all ned files in the current 
        directory and subdirectories.

        * opp_makemake_vc.pl renamed to opp_nmakemake

	* use .cmd files with NT command line extensions (%~ notation)
	to run opp_test, opp_makedep, opp_nmakemake and splitvec from Windows 
	command prompt

	* removed 'require Cwd' from perl scripts: we don't want to use any
	Perl modules, to avoid having to bundle a full Perl distribution into
	the Windows installer

2002-11-14  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: changes for Windows

	* opp_makemake_vc.pl: added makefile creator for MSVC. 100% Perl,
	no other Unix tool needed. The created Makefile.vc includes 
	configuser.vc for all compiler, linker, etc settings.

2002-10-30  Andras Varga

	* tcl2c.c: commented out old code for Borland C++, it was in the way
	when compiling with MinGW. BC is not supported anyway.

2002-10-19  Andras Varga

	* opp_test: added %global option; it can be used with %activity 
	and its body will be placed into the C++ source at global scope,
	so it's a good place for helper functions, etc.

2002-06-12  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* opp_makemake.in (htmldocs): Target htmldoc renamed to
	htmldocs. Now, creates directory htmldoc instead of html
	(clean): remove automatically generated documentation
	(htmldocs): use | instead of / as sed separator where file pathes
	can occur

2002-06-11  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* opp_makemake.in (doxyconf): new variable; names the doxygen
	configuration file
	(nedfiles): new variable, holds all ned files including those in
	sub-directories
	(neddoc.html): new Makefile target for NED documentation
	generation. Creates neddoc.html
	(htmldoc): new Makefile target for C++ code documentation
	generation. Docu is placed into ./html sub-directory
	(doc): new Makefile target that calls target neddoc.html and
	htmldoc
	(): various code for NED file collection; exludes NED files that
	contain experimental subclassing ("//--subclassing--")

	* opp_neddoc.in: use OMNETPP_UTILS_DIR as path to
	neddoc.xsl. Added signal traps and a cleanup() function

2002-06-10  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* Makefile.in (all): copy opp_neddoc to bin dir.

	* opp_neddoc.in (NEDDOC_XSL): use OMNETPP_UTILS_DIR as path to
	neddoc.xsl

2002-07-07  Andras Varga

	* added NED documentation tool (neddoc.xsl, opp_neddoc, 
	opp_neddoc.cmd)

2002-05-04  ------ omnetpp-2.2 released ------

2002-04-06  Andras Varga

	* opp_test added (moved here from test/); makefile installs it into bin/
        * makedep.pl renamed to opp_makedep and made a standalone program;
        makefile installs it into bin/

2002-04-02  Ulrich Kaage <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>  <kaage@int.etec.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        target. [patch by Johnny Lai]

2002-01-23  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* opp_makemake.in (clean): remove also *_n.h files.

2001-10-18  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* opp_makemake.in: introduced NEDCFLAGS and NEDCOPTS so that
	compile flag -Wno-unused can be used for compiling _n.cc files
	only. NEDCFLAGS is defined in configure.in and set in
	configure.user in the top level directory.

2001-08-28  Andras Varga 

	* added makedep.pl. The makedepend program in newer XFree versions
        (4.0 up?) is unusable because it no longer supports the -Y option :(
        This Perl script I found on the web and enhanced it significantly.

2001-06-19  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* Makefile.in (all): use "ln -sf" instead of "ln -s" to avoid an
	error when link already exists.

	HTML files (usman.html, toc.html plus chapN.html files); it also
	adds heading numbering.

2000-04-10 Andras Varga
