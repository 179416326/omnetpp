2003-01-23  Andras Varga

	* "Step" button in module inspectors replaced with 3 buttons ("Run 
	until next local event", "Fast run until next local event", "Stop")

2003-01-19  Andras Varga

	* Cygwin fixes; put checkTckTkVersion and setupTkOptions (was generic_-
	bindings) into widgets.tcl

2003-01-16  Andras Varga

	* enhancement: inspectors: made buttons that open inspectors for other 
	objects (e.g. encapsulated message in message inspector) look like 
	other inspector fields (i.e. label+button).

2003-01-14  Andras Varga

	* enhancement: graphical module inspector: don't bug the user with 
	error dialogs if icon for a module is not found; just only display 
	the 'unknown' icon.

2003-01-12  Andras Varga

	* enhancement: usability fixes on the inspector type selection dialog

2003-01-11  Andras Varga

	* enhancement: main.tcl: appearance of menus on Unix made more 
	contemporary (via option add's)

2003-01-10  Andras Varga

	* enhancement: implemented object tree view on left of main Tkenv 
	window

2003-01-06  Andras Varga

	* misc enhancements: display string added to module inspectors
	(editable); inspector toolbar improved; rest of Tcl_SetResult() fixed;
	submodule drawing (interpretation of display strings) made entirely
	consistent with GNED; subtle bug fixed which sometimes caused display 
	string updates not take effect.

	* layout handling rules slightly changed: "p=x,y" now ALWAYS means 
	"p=x,y,exact", even if the submodule is part of a vector for which
	a "row" or "ring" autolayout is chosen automatically. (Before, "p=x,y"
	meant "p=x,y,row" or "p=x,y,ring" if the submod was in a vector,
	and this caused counterintuitive displacements because a (dx,dy) shift
	coming from the layout was superponed onto the position (x,y)).
	POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY.

2003-01-05  Andras Varga

	* enhancements: New Run and New Network icons added to toolbar, etc.

2002-12-21  Andras Varga

        * all inspector windows: added a "name bar" which displays object
        type, fullpath, with modules the module id, and the object pointer;
        also added color coding so that different inspectors of the same object
        are easier to match visually.

        * File|Create snapshot now offers to open the snapshot file in a viewer
        window.

	* added tooltips to graphical inspectors. I.e. if you position the 
	mouse over a module icon, its name, type and id will appear in a 
	tooltip.

	* added 'Simulation options' toolbar button; removed Tcl console from
	Options menu; other small UI changes

2002-12-07  Andras Varga

	* File|New network and File|New run dialogs now correctly offer choices
	of all available networks and all available run numbers

	* tkcmd.cc and other files: most direct assignments to interp->result 
	changed to Tcl_SetResult(); the ones left are tagged with FIXME comments

2002-12-06  Andras Varga

	* main.tcl: added tooltips for gauges on toolbar

2002-11-24 Andras Varga

	* modinsp.tcl: with "ring" layout, changed order of modules
	from clockwise to the more natural counter-clockwise

	* bugfix: cHead could not be inspected

2002-11-12 Andras Varga

	* ported to Tk8.4 (several 'char *' to 'const char *' changes)

	* renamed several internal methods in tklib.cc for clarity

2002-11-03  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc: clear main window when simulation is restarted

2002-10-27  Andras Varga

	* inspect.cc, tkapp.cc,..: inspectorfactory registration moved here 
	from sim/

	* reorganized source files (split large .cc and .h files)

	* reorganized the way inspectors are found and created

2002-10-26  Andras Varga

	* outvector inspectors: added basic labeling to axes

	* implemented that inspector windows are restored if you restart
	the simulation, and even if you quit/restart Tkenv. List of open
	inspectors is saved in ./tkenvrc which is automatically loaded
	on startup and written on exit. 
	
	In .tkenvrc, inspectors are identified by object name (obj->fullPath()) 
	and class name (obj->className()), so make sure to use locally unique
	names for variables you want to inspect.

	Inspector windows usually cannot be opened immediately when .tkenvrc 
	is loaded (the corresponding objects don't exist yet), so Tkenv keeps 
	a "pending inspectors list" for the inspectors to be opened.
	At each display update, Tkenv tries to find the corresponding objects 
	in the network and open inspectors for them. Be aware that this
	object search is relatively expensive operation, so Tkenv performance
	may degrade if there are too many pending inspectors. If the network
	you're running under Tkenv changes often, it's a good idea to 
	delete .tkenvrc manually sometimes to clean it from garbage (i.e. from 
	obsolete entries).
	 
2002-10-04  Andras Varga

	* error handling changed from simulation.ok() to exceptions.

2002-07-03  Andras Varga

	* modinsp2.tcl (graphmodwin_animate): set upper limit to animation 
	steps (100) so that animation of a message sending finishes in 
	tolerable time period even on very long connections.

2002-05-27  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* main.tcl (create_omnetpp_window): increased event number status
	bar field width by 3 digits - it was limited in size to 1.000.000
	events.

2002-05-04  ------ omnetpp-2.2 released ------

2002-03-14  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tkapp.h: define TKENV_EXTRASTACK dependent on the system
	architecture. Currently SUNSPARC is known to need more stack space
	with TCL/TK 8.3

2002-03-08  Ulrich Kaage <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* structinsp.cc (flush_if_needed): Compile Fix for gcc versions
	2.95.3 (complaints) and 3.0.x (errors): declare buf and s as non
	const function call arguments.

2002-03-08  Andras Varga

	* structinsp.cc (update()): keep buffer size low by periodically
        flushing it to the text widget

2002-03-05  Andras Varga

	* modinsp.cc, modinsp2.tcl: Bugfix: each display string change had
        the unwanted side effect of rearranging randomly placed submodules.
        Basic idea of fix: start Tcl's RNG from the same seed value
        at each redraw, thus we get identical results; seed is stored per
        (and in the) inspector object. 'Rearrange' button changes the seed to
        get a different arrangement.

2002-03-03  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc, tkapp.h, tkcmd.cc: adopted to changes in the sim kernel.
	(See include/ChangeLog)

	* windows.tcl: cosmetics on file viewer dialog.

	* main.tcl, menuproc.tcl: refinements on implementation of the
	View|Output vector file, Output scalar file, Snapshot file menu items.

2002-02-29  Andras Varga

	* dialogs.tcl: implemented backwards search/replace

2002-02-24  Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc: improvement on breakpoint handling.

2002-02-06  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* objinsp.cc (update): fill in class info field with message's
	classname

	* objinsp.tcl (create_messageinspector): add class info

	* structinsp.cc (update): display value and name of enums

2002-01-23  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* objinsp.tcl (create_structpanel): Added vertical scrollbars for
	those who use a lot of message fields.

	* structinsp.cc (update): 4k as buf[] size is not enough
	especially for large messages containing arrays. I have set it to
	5M !!

2001-11-25  Andras Varga

	* implemented "message subclassing": message inspectors have now a
        Fields page which displays fields exposed through the cStructDescriptor
        interface. (If there's no cStructDescriptor for the object, the Fields
        tab is missing.)

        * the default object inspector has been improved; it also displays a
        Fields page if there's a cStructDescriptor for the object.

        * TODO: Fields page will have to be refined (now it's a simple
        multi-line text widget).

        * widget.tcl: label texts created with label-sunkenlabel are now
        justfied left

2001-09-14  Andras Varga

        * updated to cModule's new display string methods

2001-09-11  Andras Varga

	* improved plugin handling: reads plugins from OMNETPP_PLUGIN_PATH
        which can be a list of directories (not just a single directory name).
        OMNETPP_PLUGIN_PATH is currently set to ./plugins (hardcoded).
        DLL file names that are looked for now correctly depend on the
        platform (*.dll on windows, .so* on *nix).

2001-09-01 Andras Varga

	* CONST_CAST() replaced by const_cast<>()

2001-07-23  Ulrich Kaage  <kaage@int.uni-karlsruhe.de>

	* tkcmd.cc (simulationOk_cmd): use macro CONST_CAST (defined at top of
	file) to avoid compilation errors with gcc-2.95.3
	(isRunning_cmd): CONST_CAST like above

2001-07-11 Andras Varga

	* tkapp.cc: Eric Wu's Tru64/MPI port. Added a few const_cast<>s because
        broken Tru64 compiler gave const errors with tcl.h.

2001-03-27  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

	* Makefile.vc change: replaced $(TKENV_EMBED_SUFFIX) with $(TKENV_EMBED_TCL).

2001-03-10  Andras Varga

	* bugfix: setDisplayString() crashed Tkenv after the network
	graphics window was closed [reported by Stefan Geisler]

	* Borland C++ support removed: I deleted the project files
	(*.ide). I added equivalent Makefile.bc files (generated from the
	BC IDE), but they are completely unsupported at the moment. If
	there's interest, it's possible that later I'll add makefiles for
	the free command-line bc5.5 compiler.

2001-02-06  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0p1 released ------

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0 released ------

	* make clean didn't delete tclcode.cc

2001-01-21  Andras Varga

	* "find" and "find next" functionality improved and now it works
	for all module output windows. Hotkeys: Ctrl-F Find, F3 or Ctrl-N
	Find next.

	* added hotkeys for step, run, etc commands: F4 Step, F5 Run, F6
	Fast Run, F7 Express Run, F8 Stop, Ctrl-F4 Step within module

2001-01-16  Andras Varga

	* fix: added Tcl_FindExecutable(argv[0]) to Tcl initialization
	code (needed by Cygwin 1.1)

2001-01-15  Andras Varga

	* new feature: debug output window (for ev<< messages) can now be
	opened for compound modules too: it accumulates messages from all
	submodules.
	[suggested by Ulrich Kaage]

	* single-stepping within a module is now possible for compound
	modules too

	* revised single-stepping within a module: now execution stops
	both *before* and *after* events in that module, and events in
	that module are done with "normal execution" (animation, etc),
	while intervening events are done with "fast execution" (rare
	inspector updates, animation disabled)

2001-01-13  Andras Varga

	* added performance status bar (simsec/sec, events/sec, events/simsec gauges)

2001-01-03  Andras Varga

	* added 2nd status bar (containing: number of messages in the FES,
	total number of messages created, number of currently existing
	message objects)

2000-09-29  Andras Varga

	* fixed a bug which caused Tkenv NOT to report an error when the
	'p' display string tag's 3rd arg (layout) was invalid

	* the 'p' display string tag's 3rd arg (layout) can now be
	abbreviated: r=row, c=col=column, m=matrix, i=ri=ring

	* added new layout to 'p' tag: exact (abbreviation: e or x); this
	lets one position modules in a module vector one by one

	* submodule display strings may use the parent module's parameters
	too

2000-08-07  Andras Varga

	* makefile changes for RPM support

2000-07-26  Andras Varga

	* fixed a bug which caused Tcl error when using ev<< or
	ev.printf() with a string than contained curly braces [reported by
	Nick van Foreest]

	* added Edit|Find... to main menu.

2000-07-17 Andras Varga

	* fixed bug in splitInspectorName()  [reported by Ulrich Kaage]

2000-06-02  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b5 released ------

	* minor fix in tkcmd.cc [reported by Richard Lyon]

2000-05-21  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b4 released ------

	* bugfix: 'Options|Load inspector list' now works again (you must
	re-generate your existing inspect.lst files)

2000-05-10  Andras Varga

	* [Tkenv]/extra-stack= option added, it specifies (in bytes) how
	much extra stack each activity() module needs when executing under
	Tkenv. This used to be hardcoded (16384), now users can fine-tune
	it. [suggested by Niko]

2000-05-07  Andras Varga

	* Makefile.vc improvements [from Balazs Kelemen]

	* tk_PatchLevel check corrected (complained about Tk 8.0.5)
	[reported by Ulrich Kaage]

2000-05-05  Andras Varga

	* implemented module parameter substitution in display strings
	(like "p=$x_pos,$y_pos"). Substitution still not supported in
	connection display strings.

	* setDisplayString() now takes effect during simulation
	execution. Tkenv also handles the new 'immediate' argument to
	setDisplayString().  Annoyance: setDisplayString() also does a
	'Rearrange randomly placed submodules'. This is not so trivial to
	change (module positions will need to be explicitly stored)...

2000-04-13  Andras Varga

	* code for Express Run (runSimulationNoTracing()) modified so that
	it prints module output (ev<<...) for the finish() functions
	[suggested by Niko]

2000-04-10  Andras Varga

	* TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false (C++ keywords)

	* in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by
	"%f","%g","%e" (eliminated a lot of gcc -Wall warnings)

2000-04-10  Andras Varga (4-10)

	* dynamic registration of user interface (TOmnetApp) classes
	introduced: Register_OmnetApp() macro added to tkapp.cc

	* changes to enable linking a Windows DLL from the library

	* adjustments because of TOmnetApp constructor changes

	* added tkenvDummy()/envirDummy(): functions which can/should be
	called from Envir in order to force the linker to include the
	Tkenv library into the executable. (These functions do absolutely
	nothing.)

2000-03-26  Andras Varga

	* 'char *' pointers made const-correct (lots of 'char *' -->
	'const char *' replacements throughout the code)

2000-01-17  Andras Varga (17-18)

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------

	* bugfix in OmnetTkApp::objectDeleted() (tkapp.cc)

	* edited error msgs in tkapp.cc

	* font settins updated for Tk8.2/Win in main.tcl

	* in dialogs.tcl, added back the grab for the STOP dialog of
	Express Run mode. (Those lines got commented out long ago for some
	reason...) Under win32, the app menu is still accessible despite
	the grab (Tk bug?).

2000-01-15  Andras Varga

	* OmnetTkApp::setup() reorganized

2000-01-09  Andras Varga

	* small modification to TOmnetTkApp's constructor

1999-12-05  Andras Varga

	* Makefile.vc added

	* prints a banner line into main window before calling finish() on
	modules TBD: should print it into per-module windows too

1999-12-04  Andras Varga

	* compiled with MSVC. Minor changes: changed int to bool in some
	places.  tkenv.dsp added. NOTE: one has to rename all .cc files to
	.cpp for compiling (ren *.cc *.cpp)!

1999-10-12  Andras Varga

	* bugfix in balloon.tcl

1999-09-05  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0b2 released ------

	* main window renamed from ".omnetpp" to "."; now modal dialogs
	cannot go behind the main window (including the big red "STOP!"
	dialog).

1999-08-30  Andras Varga

	* bugfix on the toolbar of graphical gate inspector

1999-08-13  Andras Varga

	* default width of connection arrows changed from 2 to 1 pixels to
	be consistent with GNED

1999-08-07 Andras Varga

	* "inspect network", "inspect FES" buttons added to main toolbar

1999-08-02  Andras Varga

	* OMNETPP_BITMAP_PATH turned into real path (a list of
	directories). The separator char is ";" on Windows, and ":" or ";"
	on Unix.

1999-07-17  Andras Varga

	* modinsp2.tcl: fixed bug in animdelay calibration

	* fixed a bug with inspector type selection in Inspect|By pattern
	matching..

1999-07-11  Andras Varga

	* icons.tcl added; textual toolbar icons replaced with graphics icons

	* note: because the name of each inspector window is unique, the
	help_tips() array grows monotonously as one opens new and new
	inspector windows. The array is NOT cleaned up after closing an
	insp.  window. In everyday use this small memory leak cannot be a
	problem.

	* TO DO: spaces to be added between icons

	* widgets.tcl edited --> copy it to other subdirs
1999-07-10  Andras Varga

	* arrow.cc updated from GNED (enhancement: default value of
	anchors are now 50%)

	* widgets.tcl updated from GNED

	* modinsp2.tcl: removed potential sources of division by zero

	* fixed a problem in printptr() [tklib.cc] which caused a crash on
	Sun

	* now demands at least Tcl/Tk 8.0 patchlevel 1

1999-06-21  Andras Varga

	* all sources checked in under CVS

	* makefile.in modified for use with GNU Autoconf; also renamed to Makefile.in

	* version.log renamed to ChangeLog

	* tcl2c.c moved to util/
1999-02-07  Andras Varga

	* stable version

1999-02-07  Andras Varga

	* fixed bug in outvector-window (caused div by zero)

	* cMessage and cPacket inspector redesigned

	* fixed minor bug with anim speed settings

1999-01-25  Andras Varga

	* inspector factories added

	* updated for sim172b

	* plugin support: automatically loads .tcl and .so files placed in the
	tkenv/plugins directory. Intended use: inspectors for custom classes.

1998-12-27  Andras Varga

	* updated for sim170

	* cPacket inspector added

	* setType() moved to tklib.h/.cc for easy reuse

	* makefile renamed to makefile.in

	* stack usage statistics added to simple module inspector

	*  runningModule() corrected to contextModule()


1998-08-23  Andras Varga

        * small fixes; widgets.tcl updated

1998-08-17  Andras Varga

        * dialog centering and focus problems fixed (or alleviated) on Windows

        * icon loading improved

1998-08-14  Andras Varga

        * bugfixes

1998-08-13  Andras Varga

        * support for compiled-in TCL code added.  See the makefile for
	more info and to turn it on/off.  Here's how it works: tcl2c.c
	generates tclcode.cc from the .tcl files.  tclcode.cc is in turn
	included into tkapp.cc. tkapp.cc includes tclcode.cc and uses
	compiled-in TCL code if OMNETPP_TKENV_DIR is undefined at
	compile-time.

1998-08-12  Andras Varga

        * Borland C++ 5.0 project file added (tkenv.ide)

        * fixes necessary to run Tkenv on Windows

1998-07-24  Andras Varga

        * arrow.cc changed; display string for connections changed (see Manual)

        * small fixes

1998-07-15  Andras Varga

        * small fixes

        * small improvements on gate inspector

1998-07-11  Andras Varga

1998-07-10  Andras Varga

        * module inspectors rewritten in notebook-style

        * graphical gate inspector (path inspector) added (cannot do animation yet)

        * [Tkenv]/default-run= option added

        * cWatch inspector added

        * Simulation|Restart changed to Rebuild (restart cannot be done properly)

        * several smaller improvements

1998-07-03  Andras Varga

        * added right click support

        * outvector time-range autoconfig

        * browsing can go on while simulation is executing

        * run until event number

        * animation speed ([Tkenv]/animation-speed=0..3)

1998-07-01  Andras Varga

        * Simulate|finish simulation run and |start all modules added

1998-06-26  Andras Varga

        * bugfixes; cMessage and cGate inspector improved

1998-06-25  Andras Varga

        * callFinish() incorporated

        * msg insp fixed

        * othes fixes

1998-06-17  Andras Varga

        * message names and message kind coloring during animation

        * new ini file options:
	    [Tkenv]/animation-msgnames= 0/1
            animation-msgcolors= 0/1

1998-06-11  Andras Varga

        * made compatible with sim162 (gate vector stuff)

        * small fix on output vector window tcl code

1998-06-09  Andras Varga

        * made compatible with sim162

        * removed 'container' inspector type from many classes

1998-06-05  Andras Varga

        * two small but annoying bugs fixed

        * made compatible with sim160

1998-05-18  Andras Varga

        * made compatible with sim160

1998-05-12  Andras Varga

        * makefile updated; timer calibration for animation; icon support;
    small fixes

1998-04-28  Andras Varga

        * scrollbars added to graphical module inspector

        * name field added to message inspector

        * misc improvements and bugfixes

1998-04-24  Andras Varga

        * makefile can now create shared object (libtkenv.so)

        * stuff from TOmnetTkApp's constructor move to its setup() function

1998-04-24  Andras Varga

	NEW FEATURE: graphical module inspectors and animation
	  Modules are now displayed graphically. Submodules can be drawn as
	  color rectangles, ovals or icons. (Icons are stored in the new bitmaps/
	  directory.)
	  Placement, arrangement and appearance of submodules is controlled by
	  the modules' display strings, associated with the setDisplayString(),
	  displayString() members of cModule and cGate. If you use the new
	  'display:' phrases of the NED language, the corresponding
	  setDisplayString() calls will be automatically placed into the
	  nedc-compiled code. Read doc/dispstr.txt on how to write display strings.
	  Modules that don't have display strings are placed automatically.
	  Animation of message flow has also been added.
	New ini file options:
	  [Tkenv]/animation-enabled= 0/1
	Some of the Tcl code cleaned up.
	Changes:

          * TKENV_LIBPATH environment variable renamed to OMNETPP_TKENV_DIR.

          * A new environment variable OMNETPP_BITMAP_DIR added.

	Requires sim156.
	TO DO:

          * implement reference to module parameters in display strings

          * graphical cGate inspector, showing whole path

          * graphical cQueue inspector

1998-04-15  Andras Varga (15-24)

        * work versions, not released

1998-03-26  Andras Varga

        * "Inspect As" button only offers really existing inspector types as choice

        * container inspectors redesigned to make it more intuitive to use

1998-03-19  Andras Varga

        * user interface beautifying, updating for Tk8.0

1998-02-15  Andras Varga

        * makefile changed; tkenv.a-->libtkenv.a

        * upgraded to sim151

        * use file dialogs of Tk4.2 - requires Tcl7.6/Tk4.2 from now on

        * some Tk beautifying (correct wrong packing parameters etc)

1997-10-06  Andras Varga

        * further renaming; compatible with sim148

1997-10-02  Andras Varga

        * cleaned up & renamed several member functions; compatible with sim147

1997-08-17  Andras Varga

        * updated for sim146a
	       cMsgHeap inspector added
	       extrastack() stuff added

	Still To Do:

           - "step over initialization messages"

           - cGate graphical inspector: should show the route

           - filtered message window

           - restart must be done decently: destroy+rebuild

           - implement breakpoints

           - cCompoundMod graphical inspector

           - outvector graphical inspector: add possibility to set base time

           - implement "run until event #243"

           - objects should know what inspector types can be created for
	   them.  This can be done in the inspector(int type, void *data)
	   function: if type==QUERY_TYPES then it should put list of
	   possible types to memory pointed to by `data' ptr.
