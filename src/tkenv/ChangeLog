     - options dialog (breakpoints enabled/disabled etc)
     - filtered message window
     - restart must be done decently
     - implement concrete inspectors

      opp_getsimoption/setsimoption commands
      printing of event banners
#34 Jun 26, 1997
  - 'simulation options' dialog, opp_getsimoption/setsimoption commands completed
  - prints event banners in main window (if turned on)
#35 Jun 26, 1997
  - improved on cMsg inspector
#36 Jun 27, 1997
  - hardwired font definitions collected to create_font_bindings (main.tcl)
    and thus they are a lot easier to customise
#37 Jun 27, 1997
  - Express run added, Fast Run, Animate changed (compatibity: envir92 or up)
  - the following ini file options were added (with default values):
          animation-delay = 100
          update-freq-fast = 10
          update-freq-express = 1000
          breakpoints-enabled = TRUE
          verbose-simulation = TRUE
          module-messages = TRUE
#38 Jun 27, 1997
  - 'Run until' dialog done; still to do: run until #(event number)
#39 Jun 27, 1997
  - idea that modal dialogs should stay on top isn't good: what if there
    are two modal windows??
  - cMsg, cPar inspector enhanced
  - View|Snapshot file etc. won't open window if file doesn't exist
#40 July 1, 1997
  - some bugs in #39 fixed
  - now prints event banners in module windows
  - "Inspect differently" button changed to "Inspect As.." on inspector
    toolbar
  - added single stepping within a module
#41 July 1, 1997
  - ini file entries renamed:
          verbose-simulation --> print-banners
          module-messages --> use-mainwindow
  - some inspectors modified to use toolbars
#42 July 1, 1997
  - small fixes on #41
#43 July 1, 1997
  - bug fixes and improvements on #42
  - gate inspector changed; "AsObject" and "AsGraph" icons added to many
    inspectors
#44 July 6, 1997
  - small fixes and improvements on #43
#45 July 10, 1997
  - makefile hacked to make it work with Cygnus gcc
  - 'darkblue' changed to 'blue' because Tk on Win95 didn't recognize it

     - filtered message window
     - restart must be done decently: destroy+rebuild
     - implement breakpoints
     - cCompoundMod graphical inspector
     - outvector graphical inspector: add possibility to set base time
     - implement "run until event #243"
     - objects should know what inspector types can be created for them.
       This can be done in the  inspector(int type, void *data) function:
       if type==QUERY_TYPES then it should put list of possible types
       to memory pointed to by `data' ptr.
#48 Oct 2, 1997
  - cleaned up & renamed several member functions; compatible with sim147
#49 Oct 6, 1997
  - further renaming; compatible with sim148
#50 Dec 13, 1997
  - upgraded to sim151
  - use file dialogs of Tk4.2 - requires Tcl7.6/Tk4.2 from now on
  - some Tk beautifying (correct wrong packing parameters etc)
#51 Feb 15, 1998
  - makefile changed; tkenv.a-->libtkenv.a
#52 March 19, 1998
  - user interface beautifying, updating for Tk8.0
#53 March 26, 1998

#54a-j April 15-24, 1998
  - work versions, not released
#55 April 24, 1998
  NEW FEATURE: graphical module inspectors and animation
    Modules are now displayed graphically. Submodules can be drawn as
    color rectangles, ovals or icons. (Icons are stored in the new bitmaps/
    directory.)
    Placement, arrangement and appearance of submodules is controlled by
    the modules' display strings, associated with the setDisplayString(),
    displayString() members of cModule and cGate. If you use the new
    'display:' phrases of the NED language, the corresponding
    setDisplayString() calls will be automatically placed into the
    nedc-compiled code. Read doc/dispstr.txt on how to write display strings.
    Modules that don't have display strings are placed automatically.
    Animation of message flow has also been added.
  New ini file options:
    [Tkenv]/animation-enabled= 0/1
  Some of the Tcl code cleaned up.
  Changes:
    - TKENV_LIBPATH environment variable renamed to OMNETPP_TKENV_DIR.
    - A new environment variable OMNETPP_BITMAP_DIR added.
  Requires sim156.
  TO DO:
    - implement reference to module parameters in display strings
    - graphical cGate inspector, showing whole path
    - graphical cQueue inspector
#56 April 24, 1998
  - makefile can now create shared object (libtkenv.so)

  - msg insp fixed
  - othes fixes
#65 June 26, 1998
  - bugfixes; cMessage and cGate inspector improved

  - Simulate|finish simulation run and |start all modules added
#67 July 3, 1998
  - added right click support
  - outvector time-range autoconfig
  - browsing can go on while simulation is executing
  - run until event number
  - animation speed ([Tkenv]/animation-speed=0..3)
#68 July 10, 1998
  - module inspectors rewritten in notebook-style
  - graphical gate inspector (path inspector) added (cannot do animation yet)
  - [Tkenv]/default-run= option added
  - cWatch inspector added
  - Simulation|Restart changed to Rebuild (restart cannot be done properly)

  - small fixes
#72 August 12, 1998
  - Borland C++ 5.0 project file added (tkenv.ide)
  - fixes necessary to run Tkenv on Windows
#73 August 13, 1998
  - support for compiled-in TCL code added.
    See the makefile for more info and to turn it on/off.
    Here's how it works: tcl2c.c generates tclcode.cc from  the .tcl files.
    tclcode.cc is in turn included into tkapp.cc. tkapp.cc includes tclcode.cc
    and uses compiled-in TCL code if OMNETPP_TKENV_DIR is undefined at
    compile-time.
#74 August 14, 1998
  - bugfixes
#74a August 17, 1998
  - dialog centering and focus problems fixed (or alleviated) on Windows

  - updated for sim170
  - cPacket inspector added
  - setType() moved to tklib.h/.cc for easy reuse
  - makefile renamed to makefile.in
  - stack usage statistics added to simple module inspector
  - runningModule() corrected to contextModule()
#76a-c Jan 25, 1999
  - inspector factories added
  - updated for sim172b
  - plugin support: automatically loads .tcl and .so files placed in the
    tkenv/plugins directory. Intended use: inspectors for custom classes.
#77a Feb 7, 1999
  - fixed bug in outvector-window (caused div by zero)
  - cMessage and cPacket inspector redesigned
  - fixed minor bug with anim speed settings
#78 Feb 7, 1999

  - version.log renamed to ChangeLog
  - tcl2c.c moved to util/
July 10, 1999
  - arrow.cc updated from GNED (enhancement: default value of anchors are now 50%)
  - widgets.tcl updated from GNED
  - modinsp2.tcl: removed potential sources of division by zero
  - fixed a problem in printptr() [tklib.cc] which caused a crash on Sun
  - now demands at least Tcl/Tk 8.0 patchlevel 1
July 11-13, 1999
  - icons.tcl added; textual toolbar icons replaced with graphics icons
  - note: because the name of each inspector window is unique,
    the help_tips() array grows monotonously as one opens new and new
    inspector windows. The array is NOT cleaned up after closing an insp.
    window. In everyday use this small memory leak cannot be a problem.
  - TO DO: spaces to be added between icons
  - widgets.tcl edited --> copy it to other subdirs
July 17, 1999
  - modinsp2.tcl: fixed bug in animdelay calibration
  - fixed a bug with inspector type selection in Inspect|By pattern matching..
Aug 2, 1999
  - OMNETPP_BITMAP_PATH turned into real path (a list of directories). The
    separator char is ";" on Windows, and ":" or ";" on Unix.
Aug 7, 1999
  - "inspect network", "inspect FES" buttons added to main toolbar
Aug 13, 1999
  - default width of connection arrows changed from 2 to 1 pixels to be
    consistent with GNED
Aug 30, 1999
  - bugfix on the toolbar of graphical gate inspector
Sept 5, 1999
  - main window renamed from ".omnetpp" to "."; now modal dialogs cannot go
    behind the main window (including the big red "STOP!" dialog).
------ omnetpp-2.0b2 released ------
Oct 12, 1999
  - bugfix in balloon.tcl
Dec 4,1999
  - compiled with MSVC. Minor changes: changed int to bool in some places.
    tkenv.dsp added. NOTE: one has to rename all .cc files  to .cpp
    for compiling (ren *.cc *.cpp)!
Dec 5,1999
  - Makefile.vc added
  - prints a banner line into main window before calling finish() on modules
    TBD: should print it into per-module windows too
Jan 9,2000
  - small modification to TOmnetTkApp's constructor
Jan 15,2000
  - OmnetTkApp::setup() reorganized
Jan 17-18,2000
  - bugfix in OmnetTkApp::objectDeleted() (tkapp.cc)
  - edited error msgs in tkapp.cc
  - font settins updated for Tk8.2/Win in main.tcl
  - in dialogs.tcl, added back the grab for the STOP dialog of Express Run mode.
    (Those lines got commented out long ago for some reason...) Under win32,
    the app menu is still accessible despite the grab (Tk bug?).
------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------
Mar 26, 2000
 - 'char *' pointers made const-correct (lots of 'char *' --> 'const char *'
   replacements throughout the code)
April 4-10, 2000
 - dynamic registration of user interface (TOmnetApp) classes introduced:
   Register_OmnetApp() macro added to tkapp.cc
 - changes to enable linking a Windows DLL from the library
 - adjustments because of TOmnetApp constructor changes
 - added tkenvDummy()/envirDummy(): functions which can/should be called from
   Envir in order to force the linker to include the Tkenv library into the
   executable. (These functions do absolutely nothing.)
Apr 10, 2000
 - TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false (C++ keywords)
 - in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by "%f","%g","%e"
   (eliminated a lot of gcc -Wall warnings)
Apr 13, 2000
 - code for Express Run (runSimulationNoTracing()) modified so that it prints
   module output (ev<<...) for the finish() functions [suggested by Niko]
May 5, 2000
 - implemented module parameter substitution in display strings (like
   "p=$x_pos,$y_pos"). Substitution still not supported in connection display
   strings.
 - setDisplayString() now takes effect during simulation execution. Tkenv also
   handles the new 'immediate' argument to setDisplayString().
   Annoyance: setDisplayString() also does a 'Rearrange randomly placed
   submodules'. This is not so trivial to change (module positions will need
   to be explicitly stored)...
May 7, 2000
 - Makefile.vc improvements from Balazs Kelemen
 - tk_PatchLevel check corrected (complained about Tk 8.0.5) [reported by
   Ulrich Kaage]
May 10, 2000
 - [Tkenv]/extra-stack= option added, it specifies (in bytes) how much extra
   stack each activity() module needs when executing under Tkenv.
   This used to be hardcoded (16384), now users can fine-tune it.
Know bug: 'load inspector list' doesn't work
