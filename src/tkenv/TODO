FIXME name implies "i3", "i4" etc might be introduced sometime. 
      if not, change name to "mi"?
FIXME internally, images must be named with "img:" prefix! (otherwise exit.gif, 
      proc.gif etc will overwrite the exit, proc Tcl commands!)
FIXME bold text? make it more flexible with position? 
FIXME add "t2", "t3" etc too?
FIXME doesn't interpret "\n"!

FIXME print banners on initialize() and finish()!!!

FIXME: module name changes don't propagate to graphics!

General:
 - with Tcl-embedding, cannot display README file
 - graphical FES inspector
 - CDF display for histogram classes
MANDATE Tcl 8.4!!
