    "display:" phrases, and they will hold information about how the module
    should be displayed in Tkenv or other GUI animation/interactive
    simulation tool.
    The exact format of the strings are documented in GNED's version.log.

 - ASSERT() bug fixed
 - display strings can be taken from ini file -- compatible with envir120 up
#166 August 12, 1998
 - project file for Borland C++ 5.0 added (sim_std.ide)
 - some code beautifying
 - cenvir.h moved here from the envir package
#167 August 14, 1998
 - linker bug with cWatch fixed
#167a August 17, 1998
 - too many 'simulation cancelled' error msg fixed
#167b August 19, 1998
 - some error messages improved
#168 August 21, 1998
 - cStat::collect(double,double) renamed to collect2()
   (conflicted with collect(double))
#169 August 22, 1998
 - cOutvector::collect() improved
#170a Dec 27, 1998
 Fixes:
 - ltoa() eliminated
 - vsscanf() replaced by opp_vsscanf()
 - defs.h and funcs.cc split to defs.h, util.h+cc, errmsg.h+cc
 - serious bug with stddev() corrected
 - writes to output vector file and parameter change file are now checked
 - string class renamed to opp_string to prevent name clashes with other
   class libs (e.g. STL)
 - cSimulation::doOneEvent() function introduced
 - runningmod_deleter's stack increased from 8K to 16K
 - now cancelEvent won't hang if the message was not actually scheduled
 Improvements:
 - coroutine library now detects stack overflows and able to tell actually
   used stack size (stackUsage())
 - new alternative message handling mechanism: handleMessage()
 - new file fsm.h: finite state machine for handleMessage()
 - reserved negative message kind values
 - cPacket class added
 - MK_INFO and MK_PACKET message kind values defined for cPackets
 - wait() and receive() with timeout made faster (now reuses timeout message)
#170b Dec 27, 1998
 - fixes on 170a
 - missing bc3make.bat added back (although omnetpp is probably _way_ too big
   for BC 3.1 and DOS real mode to handle...)
#170c Dec 30, 1998
 - makefile renamed to makefile.in
#170d-k Jan 1-3, 1999
 - refinements on the coroutine library; stackSize() added to cCoroutine
 - refinements on cPacket
 - restart() of c[Simple]Module removed (was not used)
 - optimizations around timeoutmsg and receive()
 - module state codes reduced to sREADY and sENDED
 - protocol.h added
 - misc bugfixes
#171 Jan 3, 1999
 - stable version
#172a Jan 25, 1999
 - inspector factories added
#172b Jan 26, 1999
 - recordScalar() for recording strings added
#172c-d Jan 26, 1999
 - calls to simulation.error() replaced by opp_error() to avoid having to
   #include csimul.cc (and half the sim. kernel with it) in each file;
   similar for opp_warning() and opp_terminate(). opp_terminate() is similar
   to opp_error(), only it does not include the word "error" in the message.
 - requires updated Envir and user interface libraries
#173 Jan 26, 1999
 - some cleanup
#174 Feb 7, 1999
 - stable version
#175 Jun 21, 1999
  - all sources checked in under CVS
  - makefile.in modified for use with GNU Autoconf; also renamed to Makefile.in
  - version.log renamed to ChangeLog
  - removed support for DOS with BC3.1
Jul 10, 1999
  - fixed bug in cQueue and cLinkedList (didn't always increment item count
    on insertion)
  - fixed bug in cPar::info(): didn't handle boolean (B) type
Aug 2, 1999
  - fixed the bug with randseed() [it was an error to call it without
    an argument] and split randseed(long seed=0) into 2 functions:
    randseed() and randseed(long seed).
  - fixed the bug in intrand(r) and genk_intrand(r) that caused division by
    zero if called with r==0; now r<=0 values cause runtime error
  - INTRAND_MAX corrected to 2**31-2
Aug 30, 1999
  - bool isScheduled() member added to cMessage: can be used to examine whether
    the message is in the Future Event Set
  - cancelEvent() behaviour changed: now it causes an error if the message
    is not in the Future Event Set. One should write code like this:
         if (msg->isScheduled())
             delete cancelEvent(msg);
         else
             // ???
    Or rather:
         if (msg->isScheduled())
             delete cancelEvent(msg);
         else if (putAsideQueue.contains(msg))
             delete putAsideQueue.get(msg);
         else
             // ???
  - cQueue::isEnqueued(cObject *) renamed to cQueue::contains(cObject *)
  - cLinkedList::isInList(void *) renamed to cLinkedList::contains(void *)
Sept 1, 1999
  - behavior of scheduleStart() changed: now it can be called (and does nothing)
    for modules using handleMessage(). The benefit is that this way code that
    creates simple modules dynamically doesn't have to know whether the module
    is using activity() or handleMessage(); the same code (which contains a
    call to scheduleStart()) can be used for both.
  - activate() [the boot procedure for simple module activity()] now checks if
    the message that starts the module is really a starter message (and not
    some other msg). This way, bugs caused by leaving out scheduleStart()
    for dynamically created modules can be detected.
  - wait() now makes sure it is called for a module using activity() and not
    handleMessage().
  - cModuleType now caches the cModuleInterface pointer. (Before it looked
    up the interface each time, based on the interface name.)
Sept 5, 1999
  - cSimpleModule's initialize(), activity(), handleEvent(), finish() made
    protected members so that they cannot be called directly by user code.
  - callInitialize() was added to cSimpleModule to enable calling initialize()
    from user code; callInitialize() was also added for cModule and
    cCompoundModule so that it can be used polimorphically.
  - added cModuleType::createInitStart(char *namestr, cModule *parentmod)
    convenience function to get a module up and running in one step.
    Does create()+buildInside()+callInitialize()+scheduleStart(now).
    Should work for both simple and compound modules.
    Not applicable if the module:
      - has parameters to be set
      - gate vector sizes to be set
      - gates to be connected before initialize()
    Now a simple module can be created on the fly by simply saying:
       mod = modtype->createAndInit("name",this);
       mod->scheduleStart( simTime() );
Sept 6, 1999
  - a couple of unsigned<-->signed changes (mostly in the statistics classes)
    to reduce the number of "gcc -Wall" warnings
Sept 7, 1999
  - initialize() and finish() moved to cModule, so you can define them also for
    compound modules
  - callInitialize() and callFinish() are also in cModule; they are defined
    in compound modules to recursively call themselves for submodules.
    callInitialize() for the compound module is called _before_, callFinish()
    is called _after_ the call on submodules.
------ omnetpp-2.0b released ------
Sept 20, 1999
  - a bug fixed in cWeightedStdDev::collect2(): cStdDev::collect() was called
    with val instead of weight*val.

Remaining -Wall warnings: "%lf", "%lg", "%le" in printf format strings.
