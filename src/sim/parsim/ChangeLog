	* several values made configurable; all entries below are in the
	[General] section:

	parsim-debug = <true/false>
	   default: true
	parsim-idealsimulationprotocol-tablesize = <int>
	   default: TABLESIZE
	parsim-mpicommunications-mpibuffer = <bytes>
	   default: 256K * (numPartitions-1) + 16K;
	parsim-namedpipecommunications-prefix = <string>
	   Windows: default value is "omnetpp" ();
	   Unix: default value is "comm/", which means pipes will be created
	   in the comm/ subdirectory.
	parsim-nullmessageprotocol-lookahead-class = <class name string>
	   class must be subclassed from cNMPLookahead
	   default: "cLinkDelayLookahead"
	parsim-nullmessageprotocol-laziness = <0..1>
	   default: 0.5

	* cnosynchronization.cc: added ev.printf() if there's no local event

	* ccommbuffer.h, cparsimcomm.h: moved to include/

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-03-01  Andras Varga

	* classes cParsimCommunications, cCommBuffer, cParsimPartition,
	cNMPLookahead became subclassed from cPolymorphic so that they work
	with updated Register_Class()/createOne(). (cParsimSynchronization
	was already a cPolymorhpic, via the cScheduler base class.)

2004-02-12  Andras Varga

	* cproxygate.cc/.h: fix: local copy of messages sent out from the
	partition was not deleted

	* communications classes: provided default impl. for broadcast()
	in base class; broadcastException() to "eat" exceptions during
	broadcasting exception (not interested in stacked exceptions...)

2004-02-11  Andras Varga

	* receiveNonblocking() changed to return false if it was interrupted;
	now it's possible to stop (and resume) parallel simulation in Tkenv.

	* implemented message filtering by tag in the communications classes
	(cParsimCommunications subclasses) -- needed to handle race conditions
	in connectRemoteGates()

2004-02-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0pre1 released ------

2003-11-13  Andras Varga

	* checked in parallel simulation code that was developed March-May 2003,
	during my stay at Monash University.
