	* cnosynchronization.cc: added ev.printf() if there's no local event

2004-05-15  ------ omnetpp-3.0a4 released ------

2004-03-22  ------ omnetpp-3.0a3 released ------

2004-03-20  Andras Varga

	* ccommbuffer.h, cparsimcomm.h: moved to include/

2004-03-03  ------ omnetpp-3.0a2 released ------

2004-03-01  Andras Varga

	* classes cParsimCommunications, cCommBuffer, cParsimPartition, 
	cNMPLookahead became subclassed from cPolymorphic so that they work
	with updated Register_Class()/createOne(). (cParsimSynchronization
	was already a cPolymorhpic, via the cScheduler base class.)

2004-02-12  Andras Varga

	* cproxygate.cc/.h: fix: local copy of messages sent out from the 
	partition was not deleted

	* communications classes: provided default impl. for broadcast() 
	in base class; broadcastException() to "eat" exceptions during
	broadcasting exception (not interested in stacked exceptions...)

2004-02-11  Andras Varga

	* receiveNonblocking() changed to return false if it was interrupted;
	now it's possible to stop (and resume) parallel simulation in Tkenv.

	* implemented message filtering by tag in the communications classes
	(cParsimCommunications subclasses) -- needed to handle race conditions
	in connectRemoteGates()

2004-02-04  ------ omnetpp-3.0pre1 released ------

2003-11-13  Andras Varga

	* checked in parallel simulation code that was developed March-May 2003,
	during my stay at Monash University.
