	* Added ChangeLog. The Eventlog library was added in omnetpp-4.0. 
	It implements reading and traversing eventlog files recorded by 
	simulations, and also provides a command-line tool (eventlogtool).  
	Files >2GB are supported. The lib is used by Sequence Charts
	in the IDE. Author: Levente Meszaros.
