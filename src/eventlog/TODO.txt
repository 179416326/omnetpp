Event Log Tool
==============

Features:
 + load simulation log files
 + load pre-filtered simulation log files created with third party tools
   as long as only whole events are filtered out
 + print file offsets for event numbers
 + print event lines for event file offsets
 + print coherent event number ranges found in simulation log file
 + check simulation log file consistency
 + filter and echo simulation log file based on:
   + event module ids
   + event module names
   + event module types
   + message ids
   + message tids
   + message eids
   + message etids
   + message names
   + message types
   + single event number range
   + single simulation time range
   + traced event number
     + with causes
     + with consequences
 + flags turned on and off:
   + omit log lines
   + omit initialization
   + verbose mode
 + support patterns for name and type filters
 + lazily load big log files to decrease startup time and memory footprint for:
   + event log table
   + sequence chart
   + animation
 + support files greater than 2(4) Gbyte
 - memory management is completely ignored for now, anything that is loaded remains in memory until the whole event log is deleted
 + int64 sim time
 - prefetching events so that getEventForEventNumber and filtering will not call binary search all the time
 - load small files (less then 100 Mbytes) at once? (or trust lazy loading to be efficient in this case too?)

Known bugs:
 - filtering seems to be slower than expected, further investigation and measurements needed
