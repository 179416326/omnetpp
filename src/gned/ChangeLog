	* ebnf.y: Eric Wu's Tru64/MPI port. Tru64 needs extra #includes.

2001-05-18  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.1 released ------

	* Windows: added rc file with icon

2001-05-02  Andras Varga

	* fixed Help|README when using compiled-in Tcl code

2001-04-20  Andras Varga

	* bugfix in new WinMain() startup code

2001-04-16  Andras Varga

	* GNED can now be compiled as GUI application (not console app) on
	Windows, setting USE_WINMAIN=yes in configuser.vc.  NOTE: main()
	and WinMain() use completely different startup sequences.  The
	reason: main()'s startup code with WinMain would result in an
	"unknown channel stdout" error in the Tcl code (and it's not so
	easy to create a dummy channel named stdout), while WinMain()'s
	startup sequence with main() would result in a working command
	prompt in the console window (!!!).  Pretty weird.

	* added gned.ico

2001-03-27  Andras Varga

	* Makefile.vc change: replaced $(GNED_EMBED_SUFFIX) with
	$(GNED_EMBED_TCL).

2001-03-10  Andras Varga

	* Borland C++ support removed: I deleted the project files
	(*.ide). I added equivalent Makefile.bc files (generated from the
	BC IDE), but they are completely unsupported at the moment. If
	there's interest, it's possible that later I'll add makefiles for
	the free command-line bc5.5 compiler.

2001-02-13  Andras Varga

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0p1 released ------

	* ------ omnetpp-2.0 released ------

	up newlines)

2001-02-06  Andras Varga

2001-01-21  Andras Varga

	code (needed by Cygwin 1.1)

2001-01-02  Andras Varga

	* cosmetic changes in plotedit.tcl

2000-12-22  Andras Varga

	* implemented scrolling for the tabs strip (the one with the names
	of the open canvases) if there're too many tabs on it

2000-12-18  Andras Varga

	* implemented Channel Properties dialog

	* old display string classes (disp.cc) removed

	* small bugfix on comment handling in Properties dialogs (no
	longer adds extra blank lines)

2000-12-17  Andras Varga

	* improvement: switching from text mode to graphics made faster:
	now GNED won't parse the ned source if it hasn't been edited

	* improvement: GNED will refuse to exit or close a NED file if
	there are text mode canvases with edits. You'll have to switch
	those canvases to graphics to get the NED source backparsed.

	* Connection Properties dialog implemented. (Cannot handle 'for'
	loops yet.)

2000-11-20  Andras Varga

	* improvement: File|Close and File|Exit made more graceful -- the
	"Not saved, save?" dialog now has a Cancel button

	* improvement: implemented File|Save all

	* bugfix: new submodules, modules, channels etc. now always get
	unique names

2000-11-19  Andras Varga

	* bugfix: removed bogus asserts around parsened.cc#70 and #140
	which caused the program to abort when NED code contained two
	submodules with the same name when switching from text to
	graphics.

2000-11-19  Andras Varga

	* display string handling rewritten. Now GNED won't delete from
	the display strings the tags it doesn't understand. New file:
	dispstr.tcl.

	* XML support (experimental): GNED can now export and import XML
	files.
	(File|Import XML...,Export XML... menu items) New files in GNED:
	genxml.tcl, parsexml.tcl.

	* IMPORTANT! XML SUPPORT REQUIRES THE TclXML PACKAGE, at least
	version 1.2.
	(The contents of TclXML-1.2.tgz should be extracted under the
	tcl/lib/ dir.)  BUG in the TclXML-1.2 parser: it silently discards
	attributes which contain '&' or '<' characters!!!!

2000-09-30  Andras Varga

	* improvement just for Cygwin: lexer now explicitly ignores '\r'
	(=CR) chars

2000-08-29  Andras Varga

2000-04-10  Andras Varga

	* in the C++ sources, TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false
	(C++ keywords)

	* in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by
	"%f","%g","%e"

	Tcl/Tk accepts both.

        * added generated files enbf.tab.c and lex.yy.c to CVS to make it
	possible to build GNED where flex/bison is not available
