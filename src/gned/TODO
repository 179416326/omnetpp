To be finished (top priority!):
- improve comment handling in all dialogs!!!

Parse/Generate:
- comments around display strings, channel attributes are lost
- add default comments for newly created modules!
- after an "import", generates an empty line into the code
- should eliminate "staircase comment" effect, like:
    param1: string,
                    // param2: string;

Drawing:
- connection drawing doesn't work sometimes (can't reproduce...)
- random placement of submods should be the same as in Tkenv
- should support ovals too (not only rects)
- it's possible to fool the connection drawing: if, while dragging out
  a connection, you click the righ mouse button and release both mouse buttons
  over the menu that popped up, the half-cooked connection arrow will stay
  on the canvas
- drag&drop doesn't obey "snap to grid" setting

Load/save:
- command-line args: 'glob' doesn't handle filenames with "\" on Windows
- should refuse to load the same file twice
- load: if there's a parse error, load the whole stuff into a "scratch" text-mode canvas?

Text editor:
- <Enter> in the Find/Replace dialog causes error (at least in Windows)
- pgup, ctrl-pgup doesn't work correctly  *** Tk problem!***
- syntax highlighting not 100% OK: it can be fooled with string constants
  containing `//' or `\"' sequences; `in:' and `out:' are not highlighted
  *** can't be easily fixed ***
- syntax highlight: <paste> should update the whole file

General:
- on Windows, Ctrl-F4 causes runtime error if the current canvas is in text mode
- display string: numeric parameters must be checked!!!
- cut,copy,paste should work everywhere (menu,toolbar,keys), for both text and graphics
- ctrl-mousemove should copy the items on canvas
- different vertical toolbar when changing from graphics to NED view;
  on that toolbar: Find, Replace
- improve tab strip scrolling
- reduce number of "array names ned ..." lines -- they're SLOW!
  --> introduce "ownedkeys" attr and rewrite deleteItem, connKeysOfItem, etc.

Dialogs:
- remove "doc comments" from tables, and replace with "..." button
- replace param type, gate dir, etc entries with combo boxes
- check data entered in dialogs (nonempty, legal chars, unique etc.)
- process comments (add newlines, etc.)
- process imports: strip/add quotes -- maybe quotes should be stripped/added
  during parsing/NED generation??
- support 'for' loops in "Connection Properties" dialog (connprops.tcl)
- check all dialogs if everything works

Longer-term plans:
- consistency checks (params, gates etc.)
- default icon for modules (needs NED grammar change)
- opening simple modules, networks, channels, etc. on canvas
- autoload a NED library on startup (sets of simple modules etc.)
- error recovery in the grammar
- UNDO feature (at least one step) [from Niko]
- drag connections from one module to another (disconnect/reconnect) [from Niko]
