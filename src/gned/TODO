Parse/Generate:
- generation with multiple channel attributes is wrong: don't need "-->"
  between "error xxx" and "delay xxx"!
- comments around display strings are lost
- display string parsing -- rewrite!!!
- default comments for modules
- comments -- choose different approach?
- ebnf.y changed (gate_mod_L --> mod_L etc.) -- update and test NEDC!!!
- error recovery: TBD

Data struct change:
- "source-text" attribute to module?? should be added when one switches to text mode
- nedfile: name/filename is not good! maybe filename/filenamevalid?
- nedfile: add "dirty" attribute?
- turn display strings into independent objects?

Drawing:
- arrow.cc was modified!!! update in Tkenv!!!
- if canvas is scrolled, mouse selection works with wrong positions
- shift+click leaves a dot on canvas
- paste does not work between canvases

Load/save:
- fileClose does not work
- save: for canvases switched to text, it should save the text version
- load: if there's a parse error, load the whole stuff into a "scratch" text-mode canvas?

Text editor:
- find/replace
- pgup, ctrl-pgup doesn't work correctly
- make status line: line number etc.

General:
- display string: numeric parameters must be checked!!!
- cut,copy,paste should work everywhere (menu,toolbar,keys),
  for both text and graphics
- ctrl-mousemove should copy the items on canvas
- different vertical toolbar when changing from graphics to NED view

Manager:
- local menu on components: Close canvas, Properties

Dialogs:
- TBD
