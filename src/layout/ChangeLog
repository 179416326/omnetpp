	* Bugfixes and cleanup of "classic" layouting algorithm
	- fix: dynamically created modules in Tkenv often ended up outside
	  the compound module rectangle (see test/anim/dynamic2 test)
	- initial random placement to use the area already occupied by fixed
	  nodes (but minimum 600x400)
	- removed scalingMode, setConfineToArea(), setScaleToArea(); related
	  functionality is now interal to the layouter class
	- removed several tweaks and nonlinearities from layouting code
	- removed unused CONTRACTING_BOX code
	- renaming of variables ("from"/"to" to "src"/"target", etc)

	* library renamed to opplayout

	* basicspringembedderlayout: changed initial rect to 1000x1000 (was 100x100)

	* Started the ChangeLog. The Layout library was added in omnetpp-4.0.
	It implements graph layouting algorithms, used for rendering networks
	and compound modules in the IDE (graphical NED editor, NED documentation
	generator), and in the runtime environment (Tkenv). BasicSpringEmbedderLayout
	was taken from 3.x Tkenv; the other, more advanced algorithms were
	implemented by Levente Meszaros.
