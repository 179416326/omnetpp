#77  Feb 28, 1997
  - adopted to envir81 and sim109
#78  Mar 15, 1997

#81  Apr 11, 1997
  - opt_helponly moved from envir package to cmdenv
#82  Apr 22, 1997

#86 Jul 20, 1997
  - removed TCmdenv::foreignputs()
#87 Jul 31, 1997
  - [General]/number-of-runs= ini file option was replaced by
    [Cmdenv]/runs-to-execute=.
    Now it's possible to say things like:
       [Cmdenv]
       runs-to-execute = 1,2, 5-8
    There is a command-line equivalent: -r1,2,5-8
    If the list of runs is not given explicitly, executes all runs
    that have an ini file section; if no runs are given in the ini file,
    does one run.
  - compatibility: envir97 or newer
#88 Aug 7, 1997
  - cNetSimpleMod corrected to cNetMod

Sept 20, 1999
 - typo fixed in Makefile.in: $(CLFAGS) --> $(CFLAGS)
------ omnetpp-2.0b2 released ------
Dec 4,1999
  - compiled with MSVC. cmdenv.dsp added. NOTE: one has to rename all .cc files
    to .cpp for compiling (ren *.cc *.cpp)!
  - To Do: check heap.cc
Dec 5,1999
  - Makefile.vc added
------ omnetpp-2.0b3 released ------
Mar 26, 2000
 - 'char *' pointers made const-correct (lots of 'char *' --> 'const char *'
   replacements throughout the code)
April 4, 2000
 - dynamic registration of user interface (TOmnetApp) classes introduced:
   Register_OmnetApp() macro added to cmdenv.cc
April 6-10, 2000
 - changes to enable linking a Windows DLL from the library
 - memoryIsLow() reorganized; cosmetic changes on heap.cc
 - adjustments because of TOmnetApp constructor changes
 - added cmdenvDummy()/envirDummy(): functions which can/should be called from
   Envir in order to force the linker to include the Cmdenv library into the
   executable. (These functions do absolutely nothing.)
 - TRUE/FALSE (defines) replaced by true/false (C++ keywords)
 - in printf() statements, all "%lf","%lg","%le" was replaced by "%f","%g","%e"
May 7, 2000
 - Makefile.vc improvements from Balazs Kelemen
May 10, 2000
 - [Cmdenv]/extra-stack= option added, it specifies (in bytes) how much extra
   stack each activity() module needs when executing under Cmdenv.
   This used to be hardcoded (8192), now users can fine-tune it.
------ omnetpp-2.0b4 released ------
------ omnetpp-2.0b5 released ------
June 6, 2000
 - heap.cc, operator new fixed: when out of memory, it doesn't return NULL
   but calls exit(1). (According to the ISO standard, op new should throw an
   exception when out of memory. Unfortunately, exceptions are incompatible
   with the coroutine library's setjmp/longjmp magic, so OMNeT++ doesn't use
   exceptions at all.)
HEAP.CC TO BE TESTED!!!
------ omnetpp-2.0 released ------
