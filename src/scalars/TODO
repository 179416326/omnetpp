Implement selection sets: 
- turn main window into tabbed pane, each page a selection set. 
  First, unclosable page: "All". 
- after filtering, one can click a "Create selection set" icon
- selection sets can be deleted (closing the tab); shrunk to current
  filtering or selection; selected items removed.
- another toolbar button: "Add listed/selected scalars to another selction set"
- MAIN USE: "Create chart" dialog should use selection sets as input.
  "Use selections sets as input:" listbox -- by default it'd say 
  "current selection set". "Add/Remove selection sets" buttons.

Matching: do SUBSTRING search by default, and have a checkbox to select 
full string search
