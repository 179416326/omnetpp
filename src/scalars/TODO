Implement selection sets: 
- turn main window into tabbed pane, each page a selection set. 
  First, unclosable page: "All". 
- after filtering, one can click a "Create selection set" icon
- selection sets can be deleted (closing the tab); shrunk to current
  filtering or selection; selected items removed.
- another toolbar button: "Add listed/selected scalars to another selction set"
- MAIN USE: "Create chart" dialog should use selection sets as input.
  "Use selections sets as input:" listbox -- by default it'd say 
  "current selection set". "Add/Remove selection sets" buttons.

Matching: do SUBSTRING search by default, and have a checkbox to select 
full string search

Display basic statistics of variables displayed: mean, stddev

Draw histogram?

Filter: values between [...] and [...]

Chart properties dialog: create/apply "Preset" chart styles (can be implemented 
with a Tcl array)

<all> - change to "*"

close scalar file

charts: also show them as table with numbers

merge with Plove -- "vector" pages, "scalar" pages; "convert vector to 
scalar" (would create scalars with mean, stddev, min, max, etc...)

Chart properties dialog: only one of the "Lines", "Bars" page should appear.

BLT graph: eliminate interference of crosshair zoom and active legend!

Better handling of errors during file load

Check compatibility with different BLT versions

Mention Excel's Pivot Table and OpenOffice's Data Pilot functionality 
in the documentation

implement "Copy special"

require BLT 2.4z -- if {$blt_patchLevel!="2.4z"} {error "BLT too old"}
