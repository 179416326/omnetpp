	* Started the ChangeLog. The Scave library was added in omnetpp-4.0. 
	It implements reading and processing of result files (output vector
	files .vec, and output scalar files .sca) and it is used by the 
	Analysis tool in IDE. A command-line tool scavetool is also provided.
	Initial code was taken from the 3.x Plove and Scalars tools, then
	it was significantly expanded by Tamas Borbely.
